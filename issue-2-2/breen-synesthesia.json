Yeats believed that magic was central not only to his art, but to a dawning epoch when spirituality and technology would march together toward an uncertain future.",

It was written by Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater, erstwhile members of the [London Theosophical Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society) alongside Yeats, and it features a stunning sequence of images that illustrate the book’s central argument: emotions, sounds, ideas and events can all manifest as visual auras.",

In other words, the book was about [synesthesia](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/03/12/174132392/synesthetes-really-can-taste-the-rainbow) (a phenomenon in which one sensory pathway, like sound, simulates another, like vision). The illustration of the music of Mendelssohn reproduced above, for instance, depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church. This, Leadbeater and Besant explain, “signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively.” Moreover, “the scalloped edging surrounding the whole is the result of various flourishes and arpeggios, and the floating crescents in the centre represent isolated or staccato chords.” Color and sound had become [commingled](/blog/2013/10/experimental-music-and-color-in-the-nineteenth-century).",

Leadbeater had originally been ordained as a priest in the Church of England, but he developed an intense fascination with Buddhism and Hinduism following travels in Burma and Sri Lanka with [Henry Steel Olcott](http://www.theosophical.org/henry-s-olcott) in 1885. He grew convinced that he possessed powerful psychic abilities and became a disciple of Madame Blavatsky (later immortalized as Madame Sesostris in T.S. Eliot’s _The Wasteland_). Following Blavatsky’s death, Leadbeater met Annie Besant, a women’s rights activist and socialist orator, and the two struck up an unorthodox partnership. By the 1890s they had emerged as the leaders of the preeminent theosophist group in London.",

Mankind was “a spiritual intelligence… treading a vast cycle of human experience, born and reborn on earth millennium after millennium, evolving slowly into the ideal man.” It must be said: theosophy was bunk. It combined social Darwinism and echoes of Neo-Raphaelite romanticism with a kind of Westernized, mashed-together Buddhist and Hindu thought, then topped it with a dash of High Church ceremony and a healthy heaping of obfuscatory verbiage. The result, more often than not, was pompous, pseudoscientific nonsense.",

In his 1704 book _Opticks_, Isaac Newton’s arbitrary division of the spectrum into seven colors (ROYGBIV) resulted in the quasi-color indigo, whose questionable differentiation from blue befuddles schoolchildren to this day.

Each ray corresponded to a group of historical figures (“Masters” or “Mahatma”) who were reborn in an unending cycle, and each had a characteristic color. In Besant and Leadbeater’s [elaboration of Blavatsky’s ideas](http://books.google.com/books?id=2dg2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=%22higher+classes+were+of+a+quite+respectable+blue%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m5HcNjdtXP&amp;sig=jjo48K5JJEQB9l_P50e7OkwrPLQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y38aU_ioMZLo2gXm5oGwAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ), the various permutations of the theory become impossibly confusing.
