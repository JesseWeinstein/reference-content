Los Angeles-based artist and animator Jed McGowan, who released the wordless comic “Voyager” last year (you can read our post about it [here](http://theappendix.net/blog/2013/9/history-of-outer-space)), has outdone himself with his second self-release about the formation and eventual destruction of the Hawaiian island chain. “I knew I didn’t want humans in the comic,” McGowan [has said](http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=50827) about his take on the _Voyager_ probe, “but I still wanted something that was emotional, with a clear beginning, middle and end.” The same approach is in play here: McGowan offers up a sensitive visual narration of the natural forces that shape a landscape, humanizing a process that is almost inconceivable in its immense temporal and geological scale.",

For the “Bodies” issue, we decided to highlight the panels from “Hawaii” which visualize the corporeal forms of the earth itself—the vast tectonic plates and oceans of magma that give our planet a corporeal shape and substance. As McGowan shows, even these impersonal forces have stories to tell.",
