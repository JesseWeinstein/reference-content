Forty-five years later, the Spanish artist Victor Patricio de Landaluze represented the ñáñigo as part of his volume that cataloged social “types” particular to Cuba. Landaluze’s illustration captures a performative pause.",

The figure performs a visual language of gestures in sharp, angular, staccato movements. The movements at times embody the utterances of the _ekué_ drum. In this way, the ñáñigo acts as a guardian of ritual and as a “spiritual messenger,” according to the art historian David H. Brown.",

Brown astutely notes that Landaluze’s realism “disciplined the bodies and gestures of the íreme through classical figuration and the views he offered to beholders.” He compares the dynamic counterpoint of the íreme’s performed gestures to the balanced stasis the viewer encounters in Landaluze’s rendition–more akin to the classical statuary of a Greek Zeus than what might be observed when the íreme dances.",

The volume details in costumbrist fashion, via text and image, the various social “types” to be found on the island. Landaluze also illustrates the figures of the cockfighter, the cigar maker, the country peasants, the “mulata of the street,” and the lottery ticket vendor, among others. Costumbrist works in Europe and Latin America, through their construction of social types, contributed to the formation of a national identity, according to [May-Yen Moriuchi](http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring13/moriuchi-nineteenth-century-mexican-costumbrismo). However, foreign artists who completed costumbrist works often exoticized their subjects.",

In the late nineteenth century, the Spanish colonial government persecuted Abakuá members as the end of the slave trade loomed near. Abakuá’s association with murder and fear continued into the twentieth century. Abakuá was a plague on society, and Abakuá members “the bogeyman of Cuban history,” in [Ivor Miller’s words](http://www.afropop.org/wp/1752/1752/).",

She characterizes these images as constructions of a kind of “black savagery” specifically linked to the multi-racial insurgent movement taking shape in eastern Cuba. In this sense, “Landaluze’s images suggest that the communion of white and black soldiers on the field was leading down a path of social miscegenation and disorder.”",

A black servant, probably a slave, stands behind a white woman and her child as they watch, all safely out of reach in their home.",

Paradoxically, Landaluze’s abstraction of the figure urges us to examine these details. Our eye moves through the rhythm of the strong diagonal, vertical, and horizontal lines of the suit’s checkered and striped pattern. We stop at the ñáñigo’s ankles, wrists, and waist where raffia and bells sprout forth. From a dark hole, the dancer looks in the direction of the stick pointed in his left hand. The fronds and rooster’s feathers, hanging from his waist, augment the actual size of the figure along with the point of his mask–further embellished by the shadow on the wall.",

        "content": "Landaluze’s attention to detail has led some scholars and historians to read the image for its value as an ethnographic document. Indeed, Ivor Miller, in his work with contemporary titleholders of Calabar Ékpè (leopard) societies, [suggests](http://books.google.com/books?id=MjdFOUQBCEAC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=%22Ivor+Miller%22+%22enlightened+state%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wgk2g0u_QE&amp;sig=gTzr7sOO5EuiXYIJ8GhLagkH5Ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WM8SU_eZOIWN2gX-poHoDA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ivor%20Miller%22%20%22enlightened%20state%22&amp;f=false) that the suit’s patterns represent the spots of a leopard associated with a particular grade in the society. He also cites the vertical nature of the mask as an important symbol of the “enlightened state” of the grade. However, applying the reading of contemporary titleholders in Africa to the image overlooks the possibility of new meanings assigned to the pattern of the suit in colonial Cuba. David Brown, in contrast, offers that the suit may have been modeled after a masquerade known as _Embema_, a royal figure associated with the forest.",

We wonder, but the moment of stillness suggests imminent movement. Our observation escapes us–we wait for the íreme to move and break his stance. We wait for the bells to sound.",
