The explorer’s language acumen, “tolerably thorough acclimation,” and connections to Gabonese coastal traders promised to serve him well among the fascinating “tribes of the interior.” If he could collect new animal specimens, observe scintillating African behaviors, and cover fresh territory in the interior, Du Chaillu stood a good change of leaving his status as “field collector” behind and making his way into a royal society.",

As colonial expeditions opened up new inroads into Western Equatorial Africa, ethnographic accounts moved from relative scientific obscurity to sensationalized fascination, nervously read by Victorian elites.

Once in Gabon’s overwhelming forests, comparing plant and animal species to field guides would have been next to impossible. Fang informants guided Western explorers to known gorilla nests and passed on successful tracking and hunting methods. In all likelihood, Fang communities informed more than just field knowledge—their stories about gorillas and cannibalism eventually made their way into Western ‘scientific’ writing.

Rather than reading these stories as mere “fantasies of racist outsiders” designed to sell books, we can study Western incorporations of African stories to reveal more complex Fang speculations predating the arrival of explorers. Fear of gorillas’ physical similarity to men ran rampant in Fang as well as Victorian society. For the people who encountered the beasts regularly, gorilla stories pointed to the blurriness of the human/animal boundary, and stood in as metaphors for unexplainable atrocities.",

It is, of course, easy to see how cannibalism may have been used as a narrative device intended to shock readers and to represent an utter lack of morals in supposedly uncivilized peoples. But stories of cannibalism also circulated among Western Equatorial Africans both as representations of loss of bodily control and as a scare tactic designed to confine trade to one’s own community.",

Despite the fact that cannibalism did not, in fact, occur in Western Equatorial Africa, stories circulated throughout most West African societies, in white settlements along the coast, and in sensationalist and scientific texts back in Britain.",

It is possible that these ludicrous passages truly were products of an editor’s creative work. In any case, Du Chaillu’s apparent ‘field knowledge’ existed within frameworks of what Victorian readers expected when buying an African travel account, and what Western Equatorial Africans talked about in the interior.

It is common knowledge that Western explorers defined their whiteness, masculinity, and general superiority against the savage, ape-like, and deviant ‘other.’ It should be said, though, that studying on-the-ground interactions with the Fang tends to complicate Pratt’s theory.

                "After the publication of _Explorations and Adventures_ in 1861, a number of well-known explorers with more formal training went to Gabon in efforts to correct Du Chaillu’s more controversial findings. Burton and Kingsley, among others, denied his claims about gorilla savagery and presented murkier findings on Fang cannibalism. Perhaps to Du Chaillu’s credit, other explorers gave far more colonial accounts of their travels through Gabon. Burton finished his days with “quinine, julienne and tea, potatoes and potted meats, pipes and cigars,” while Kingsley repeatedly noted her “continual desire for hair-pins.”"

                "Although she claimed that she would “not tell you any cannibal stories,” Mary Kingsley was sure to mention that the Fang had “no slaves, no prisoners of war, no cemeteries, so you must draw your own conclusions.” Burton remained skeptical, noting that coastal Africans told these stories to “deter foreigners from direct dealings,” and that “a joint of ‘black brother’ is never seen in the villages; ‘smoked human flesh’ does not hang from the rafters.” Interesting scholarship has suggested that Du Chaillu tested the boundaries of his whiteness and civilized superiority by treading dangerously close to cannibalism himself."
