In the fall of 1983, Carl Sagan had just published an article in _Parade Magazine_ on the possible long-term effects of nuclear winter.

Part of the problem with discussions of climate science is scale: change is occurring over a span of time and space that’s hard to connect with, intellectually and emotionally. Children, as many activists point out, will be alive to bear the brunt of the changes, which they did not cause. Kids’ emotions about this fact are now political. The connection between the historical fears of nuclear bombing and the present-day anxiety over climate is often explicitly drawn (a Washington Post reporter working on [a 2007 story](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/15/AR2007041501164.html) about climate change anxieties interviewed a therapist who said “Kids used to have fears of war and nuclear annihilation. That’s dissipated and been replaced by global warming”).",

The concepts of captivity, indoctrination, and impressionability that Finn and Adelson identify are now forefront in conservative criticisms of activist climate change curricula. Bjorn Lomborg complained in _The Guardian_ that “the continuous presentation of scary stories about global warming in the popular media makes us unnecessarily frightened. Even worse, it terrifies our kids.” Recounting a conversation that he had with “a group of Danish teenagers,” Lomborg claimed that one “worried that global warming would cause the planet to ‘explode.’” Lomborg emphasized that “this scare was intended,” arguing, much like Finn and Adelson had, that adults were purposefully, and unnecessarily, terrifying children.",

While activists present children’s feelings as crushing, final evidence of the awfulness of a problem, conservatives raise several levels of doubt: first, that the phenomenon prompting these fears is as bad as claimed; second, that kids even feel as badly as activists say they do; third, that such feelings are “natural,” rather than stoked up by liberal agitation in the form of media and curricula. This idea that children are the truth-tellers, closer to the marrow of human experience, is part of a sentimental Romanticism that conservative onlookers decry, arguing that we can’t conduct national policy based on the anxieties of children.",

Kids are afraid; moms are afraid; therapists make soothing noises; men know the truth of the risks, see the real possible futures, and act accordingly.",
