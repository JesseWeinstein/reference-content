Her offspring, the Child of Reformation, is destined to overrun the nation with meddling. She struggles, sweats, and vomits. Her visitors and attendants cannot relieve her suffering. The birth pangs of her monstrous body, both female and legislative, are a foul clarion call for the embattled king’s loyal supporters. The future is coming. It is disgusting and transgressive; it must be avoided at all cost.",

The Second English Civil War (1648-1649) was well underway, the reigning sovereign King Charles I was imprisoned in Parliamentary custody on the Isle of Wight, and England had been embroiled in civil conflict for over a decade. These events, naturally, led many writers to consider the immediate future of the polity.",

        "content": "If the future of a nation is its children, a monstrous birth is infelicitous at minimum and damning at worst. Authors of texts like this one asked their readers to imagine good, bad, and sometime even disgusting futures to galvanize support for causes ranging from King’s release to changes in tax policy. And like the _Mistris Parliament_ plays, they display the increasingly imaginative uses of sensational, national, and reproductive futurity in popular political writing. These visions of the future—positive or negative—were yoked to worldviews that tracked time according to providence and eschatology, cyclical logic, incremental decay, or, most innovatively, for the seventeenth century, progressive development. The archive of literary pamphlets from the mid-seventeenth century bears witness to this range of historical perspectives, from apocalyptic visions to local satires, triumphalist allegories, and cautionary tales. Whichever perspective governed the historical logic of a particular publication, one through line remained stable: The future of the nation was at stake.",

One of their most well-documented results, however, was a simultaneous lapse in press oversight and a boom in the publication of political writing. By 1648 new titles were flooding booksellers’ stalls, especially short books, polemics, pamphlets, and petitions. Newsbooks, an early form of the modern newspaper, were issued weekly or bi-weekly under the aegis of partisan “_Mercurii_” like _Mercurius Britannicus_, which promoted Parliament’s agenda, and the Royalist _Mercurius Melancholicus_, which went above and beyond to support Charles. Royalist _Mercurii_ like _Melancholicus_, _Elencticus_, and _Pragmaticus_ all also experimented with literary newsbooks and pamphlets perhaps to accompany and support their more purely journalistic efforts.",

Instead of listing publisher, printer, and bookshop on its title page, _Mistris Parliament I_ states that it was “Printed in the Yeer of the Saints fear. 1648.” The only convention it abides by is the date.",

This group of poet-journalists may have included John Crouch, George Wharton, Samuel Sheppard, John Cleveland, Samuel Butler, and the notorious Marchamont Nedham, all authors working for the prominent Royalist newsbooks in the spring of 1648. Each of these men had vested interests in the political, theological, and commercial outcomes of ongoing civil conflict: The _Mercurii_ had skin in the game and fair and balanced reporting was neither the goal nor the result of their journalistic efforts. And they took a chance by circulating a short play instead of another genre of print polemic, like a pointed prose animadversion. It looks like their bet worked out.

But political print ephemera were also discarded, used for scrap paper, or repurposed as toilet tissue, a trend “Bum Fodder” and other ballads affirm in their verses.  These short-lived pamphlets recorded the news: the day-to-day events of a nation at war with itself, the debates in Parliament and among the troops, the grievances of the capital and the countryside. Reaching beyond the journalistic present, some _Mercurii_ imagined scenes—like the birth of a child of reformation—to distinguish themselves in the crowded market and perhaps avoid an excremental fate.",

Royalist news writers perpetuated this subgenre of speculative political writing by dramatizing other abhorrent (to them) political futures where Oliver Cromwell became King of England and prominent members of Parliament communed with demons. Unlike their Parliamentarian and sectarian counterparts, who actively promoted new models for political and social organization in their pamphlets and newsbooks, Royalist journalists were far more likely to use hyperbole, demonology, and other assorted scare tactics to descry these innovations. After all, they were promoting the status quo—a return to time-worn tradition, monarchical political organization, and the world as it should be rather than “the world turned upside down” imagined by their radical contemporaries. The _Mistris Parliament_ plays document the adventures of Mistris Parliament, a grotesque feminized depiction of the corporate governmental institution. To inspire horror in loyal partisans Mistris Parliament, as we have already seen, gives birth to a monstrous reforming child in the first play, and in the subsequent issues she and her hellish offspring wreak havoc.",

The tense birthing room of early modernity is a liminal space between life and death, between future progeny and past fertility.

                "To emphasize _Mistris Parliament’s_ awing and hawing, the authors and compositors in the print shop used both onomatopoeia and expressive typography. Expressive typography describes the non-lexical features of a text including punctuation and formatting. I think that this is an especially innovative tactic for representing action in a printed play written in an era when public performance was banned. In her study of expressive typography and playbook design Claire M.L. Bourne argues that the printed editions of Ben Jonson’s humorous comical satires use long dashes to encode bodily excesses and performative gestures.",
