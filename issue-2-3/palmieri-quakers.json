But what set them apart was the volume of their printed works. During the early years of their establishment in the 1650s, Quakers published about a pamphlet a week, paid for through a collectively managed fund, and distributed by a network of itinerant preachers known as the “Valiant Sixty.” The Sixty, which were in fact more than sixty people, included George Fox, Margaret Fell Fox, Mary Fisher, and sixteen-year-old George Whitehead. Because they commanded others to tremble before the Lord, they were called Quakers, a title they re-appropriated from their critics. Among themselves, they were the Society of Friends. Unlike nearly every other group to arise out of the traumatic events of 1640s England, the Friends have survived as a religious group to this day.",

George Whitehead spent his teenage years in and out of jail for preaching unorthodox views with the kind of boldness that would have fit in with the Sex Pistols at the Silver Jubilee. From prison he wrote works such as _Cain’s generation discover’d_ (1665)_,_ and _The path of the just cleared: and cruelty and tyranny laid open_ (1655).

Even though the tone of early Quaker pamphlets was mostly apocalyptic, the system of pamphlet production and distribution the Valiant Sixty built was ultimately stronger than some of the beliefs it spread. Consumers of these publications included converts across England who had been visited at one time or another by members of the Valiant Sixty. In the absence of stable leaders and places of worship, converts were taught to form weekly Meetings to keep up the faith. The pamphlets were issued at regular intervals to encourage Meetings, and to update them about experiences of the traveling Sixty. By imagining its future in print, Quakerism took on a social life of its own and became more than just a fad.",

An earlier anti-Quaker writer, Francis Higginson, did not limit his disgust to printed matter when he complained about Quakers’ “printed Libels, and…Manuscripts that flye as thick as Moths up and down the Country.” The Quakers got as good as they gave, with detractors issuing violent outpourings of their own against them, among others Ralph Farmer’s _Sathan Inthrone’d in his Chair of Pestilence, or Quakerisim in its Exaltation_ (1657), Thomas Smith’s _A Gagg for the Quakers_ (1659), Lodowick Muggleton’s _The neck of the QUAKERS Broken_ (1663), Francis Bugg’s _Painted Harlot both Stript and whipt_ (1683).",

George Fox even wrote about the equality of men and women. Confidence in their “Inner Light” gave Quakers a certain brazen edge to their beliefs, but the “Inner Light” was also what linked Quakers to earlier religious outliers and mystics like Jakob Böhme.

But they were able to print more pamphlets than ever despite persecution and the oppressive Licensing Act of 1662. Through pamphlets and traveling preachers they had gained more followers and built new communities as far away as Barbados.

Nicholas Jorden of Bristol, and Nicholas Cole of Plymouth, were also sent to scare up printed Quaker and Anti-Quaker tracts from their parts of the country.

They ordered “the printing of J: Naylors Bookes be suspended till it be taken into further &amp; more generall Consideration by the 2d dayes meeting &amp; some Antient friends of the Citty,” and did not lift the ban for nearly two decades.",

Aside from practical reasons, works were most often rejected to prevent “reviving troubles to friends,” either with other religious groups such as Baptists, or with authorities with the power to fine or imprison the author.

The majority of works published underwent a process of communal review, and edits were negotiated with each author, and even rejection letters were written and signed collectively. Minutes record that final decisions as to the publication of manuscripts could be made by no less than three or four Friends. In reality more were usually present—sometimes including the author of a work, his or her family, or neighbors or friends which delivered manuscripts on their behalf. For more prominent publications, such as the collected works of a deceased Quaker, there were more readers: often manuscript collections were available on loan to interested readers. Equally, for more controversial books, there were more readers: for instance when a schism broke out in the Quaker colony of Pennsylvania, former Quaker George Keith’s books were reviewed by no less than 8 friends, “and any other that are Free.” The short form Quaker writings took, pamphlets, were key to this communal process of editing, because works were read aloud to all present, and edited orally as well. Over time, publishing longer works meant more frequent meetings, and more breakaway editorial committees. Only after edits were collectively agreed upon with the authors were manuscripts taken away by the printers, who were often present at the readings.",

                "What might a Quaker letter of rejection look like? See below for one from 1680, responding to a series of papers Judith Boulby wrote after the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688. The first is entitled _Woman Uncircumscised in heart_, which they do not find a standalone work worth printing. For the second work, _To the Magistrates_, in the Meeting’s minutes they condemn the work as too prophetic, including “severall severe ancient p[ro]phesys applyed to England” which the Meeting feared might get Judith into trouble [7th 12th mo [January] 1689/9]. But after two insults comes a half-hearted compliment: they accept her final paper for manuscript circulation, if she is willing to take into account their edits. The Meeting’s rejection of Judith’s epistle _To the Magistrates_, on the ground of her prophesying tone shows how far Quaker printing had strayed from its initial agenda: her “severe” prophesies would have perfectly suited the Quaker of the 1650s.<br /><br />&#160;&#160; To Judith Boulby<br />&#160;&#160; London the 18th 4 mo 1690<br />&#160;&#160; Dear Judith<br />Our Loves in the Blessed Truth Salutes thee - This is to let thee know that we have read the papers thou left with us to be viewed and Printed if we thought meet. Now as to that to the _Woman Uncircumcised in heart_, we think it not dependent with it Self; For such as Paint, Adorne, and Dress like Jezebel are farr from making clear the outside. And as to that _To the Magistrates_, We Judge it not a fitt time to print much upon that Account in this time of peace and quietness - But as to the 3d _To the followers of the Lamb_ - We have made some little alterations in it as thou wilt see, which if thou sees Meet, thou mayest give forth coppies of it, it being short, soe in the Love of God We rest thy thy Friends and Brethren in the Truth.<br />&#160;&#160; S.
