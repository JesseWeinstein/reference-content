Before photographs, films, and cross-country family vacations were common, dioramas allowed museums to show people faraway places. At the American Museum of Natural History in New York, curators commissioned their animal dioramas out of a growing fear that America’s natural lands were being destroyed. They wanted people to see and appreciate those habitats before they disappeared. “Railroads were opening up the country at this time, the great western frontier was disappearing, the vast bison herds were vanishing,” an AMNH senior project manager recently said in a museum-produced podcast. “So the scientists and curators in science museums that were concerned about vanishing wilderness and wildlife were looking for some medium to tell the story.”",

Displays such as modified dioramas and walk-in buildings maintain the older dioramas’ power to capture the imagination and show what life was like in the past. For scholars who want to see and think about how we used to display American Indian cultures, the University of Michigan’s Great Lakes dioramas are available for academic study in the basement of the building.",

At the end of the longhouse, a doorway opens out onto a painted background of the Pacific Ocean. Sculpted seagulls hang overhead on translucent wires. It’s meant to give visitors a sense of what it was like to live on the edge of the open ocean, something they cannot see where most Makah people live today. Neah Bay, where Makah villagers retreated when told to send their children to school, sits on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, not the open Pacific. For non-Makah visitors, it is a diorama in which the viewer doesn’t examine the Indian under glass, but takes her place.",

                "Bianca Message, president of André &amp; Associates Interpretation and Design Ltd., told me this story about working on the Makah Cultural and Research Center:<br /><br />The Great Slide didn’t happen to bury any canoes, but the council knew Makah people had used canoes in that time period, so they carved new ones to go into the museum. Message’s father saw the new canoes and tried to tell Greg Arnold, a Makah council member and André &amp; Associates’ primary contact, that the carvers should add a patina to the canoes so they would look old. Arnold agreed.<br /><br />Later, Message’s father returned to find an excellent-looking patina on the canoes. How did the Makah do it? “Greg said, ‘I paddled the canoes up to Canada to see our relatives and back so they would earn the right to be in our cultural center,’” Message recalled. “The integrity and the pride of the Makah was just superb.”"

                "“We don’t have dioramas,” Kathleen Ash-Milby, a curator at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., says flatly. The museum stays away from dioramas because they are associated with natural history museums’ portrayal of indigenous cultures, she says. And they make the people they portray look like “exotic stuff behind glass.” The National Museum doesn’t use mannequins, either."
