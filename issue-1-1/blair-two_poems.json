But it was at night<br />\nmy true work was done, gazing<br />\ntowards the heavens. I will never forget<br />\nthe day a book fell into my hand that<br />\ntold me how the Greeks and Arabs<br />\nhad already been about this same business,<br />\nand so I learned the names of things.<br />\nMy first telescope was made from a<br />\nbroken spyglass found in the street.<br />\nI did not search for reward but what luck<br />\nthat the Warner Prize then considered<br />\neach newly discovered comet to be worth<br />\n200.00! One comet bought my house lot,<br />\nand just as I grew anxious, another appeared<br />\nto help pay off my loan.<br />\nEventually, I drew up my courage, enquiring<br />\nif there might be a place for me at Vanderbilt.<br />\nWhen Mr. Newcomb gently said ‘no,’<br />\nciting my lack of education in math,<br />\nI nodded, then quietly drew myself behind<br />\none of the state capitol columns and wept.<br />\nEventually, they invited me to live on a<br />\nsmall house on campus, understanding<br />\nsomehow that love is its own expertise.<br />\nI took classes, and continued the work I had<br />\nalways done, charting the skies, mapping<br />\nthe Milky Way, in cold seasons wearing<br />\nanimals on my arms: a reindeer hide<br />\ncoat that more than once led me to surmise<br />\nhow the ancestors of these stitched skins<br />\nmust have tracked miles and miles over<br />\nthe hills, December evenings, nostril fumes<br />\nrising above their antlers and then up<br />into the unsurpassable territory.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n",

Yet said I, the Designer<br />\nwho made us varied and diverse is not above copying<br />\ncertain methodologies, and what harm befalls our<br />\nunique place in creation if our alimentary needs<br />\nslightly compare to those of other creatures?<br />\nI would preach out of the gospels and epistles, yet<br />\nwould return to my one theme at any spare hour.<br />\nFor yes, though our Lord taught that foodstuffs<br />\ncoming into a man’s mouth do not make him unclean,<br />\nbut, rather, the envy, malice, and lust inside him,<br />\ncould not these two things, traced at some lengths,<br />\nbe somewhat connected? So I traveled and I preached<br />\nagainst the tea, coffee, and tobacco, the cow milk of<br />\ncows fed on distillery mash. And though we ought to cry<br />\nfor daily bread, I taught that bread must more than suffice,<br />\nthe additives left out, along with the alum and chlorine—<br />\nits deceptive pleasing whiteness left for the moral inducing<br />\ntimber of whole wheat. The milk should run also clear<br />\nof the chalk and plaster of Paris lies that stain it<br />\na most unnatural hue. And I did not stop preaching,<br />\nnay even in Boston when the city bakers threatened<br />\na riot, warning young men against the all too present<br />\ntemptation to twiddle themselves, the excesses that<br />\nlead to coughs, loss of appetite, and failure of the liver<br />\nand kidneys; I also spoke to married couples of<br />\nthe lassitude that comes of constant overindulging.<br />\nOne day near the end of my life, when I was traveling<br />\nI got out of my carriage and spotted a brilliant blue<br />\nbutterfly resting on the side of a dry goods store,<br />\nand drawn by the glorious sheen, I stepped closer,<br />\nonly to find another shape resting directly underneath<br />\nthe one, and I wondered in secret, tho not for the first time—<br />\nif our minds are to always run to far higher things, why<br />\neven the smallest specks have been fashioned against us.",
