Each spring and fall brings a new *New York Times*-reviewed narrative history of some corner of the industry—a clockwork regularity that might make even the most devoted fan, the guaranteed market for these sorts of books, say, ‘So what?’ Do we really need another paean to how a particular artist drafted Wonder Woman’s boots with both strength and sexuality?",

Kirby cut loose with a whole raft of more cosmic characters, and it was clear that Marvel had nurtured him, then held him back.

The most popular characters were violent, surrounded by scantily dressed supporting characters. Hotshot artists like Todd McFarlane, Jim Lee and Rob Liefield attained unbelievable sales numbers, then walked off to found new companies—but not before more thoughtful longtime writers and editors had quit. Marvel competed by setting the market into a speculative frenzy over gimmicky hologram covers and pseudo-cataclysms.

Not only that, but they were climb-out fights. There was a monument store. There was a store that built funeral monuments, and we used to run over those monuments. We used to hop from monument to monument chasing each other. For all I know, they may still be on Suffolk Street.<br />GROTH: Now, what do you mean by a “climb-out fight”?<br />KIRBY: A climb-out fight is where you climb a building. You climb fire escapes. You climb to the top of the building. You fight on the roof, and you fight all the way down again. You fight down the wooden stairs, see? And, of course, I didn’t win all of them. You fought fair. If the other guy wants to fight and you knocked him out, you did your best for him. You didn’t want to hurt him any more. There was one time they knocked me out and laid me in front of my mother’s door. And in order for my mother not to be shocked they readjusted my clothes and they saw that nothing was rumpled and I looked very comfortable next to the apartment door, so when my mother would open the door it wouldn’t be that much of a shock.<br />GROTH: Were you actually knocked unconscious?<br />KIRBY: Well, yes.<br />GROTH: Were you ever seriously injured? Broken bones, or…<br />KIRBY: No, I don’t think so.

                "To be exact, because it matters, Lee came up with Iron Man, but the script for his first story was fleshed out by Larry Lieber. Jack Kirby designed Iron Man’s suit, but artist Don Heck drew the first issue, designing the look of alter-ego Tony Stark and the series’ early major characters. Daredevil was created by Lee and artist Bill Everett, but Kirby influenced the character’s design. (Everett was a writer-artist who created the aggressive Namor the Sub-Mariner during the first great wave of Marvel, then Timely Comics, in 1939.) All of this speaks to just how collaborative the process was—how many assignments were completed by crowds, not duos, artists pitching in to get the job done and the money in the sometimes-shared piggybank. This is what was wonderful about the early-ish days of comics; and what made it easy for the company that signed the checks to cut creators out of credit."

                "“‘Dead characters always return,’ Morrison complained of the X-Men comics of the preceding decade. ‘Nothing that happens really matters ultimately. The stage is never cleared for new creations to develop and grow.’” Indeed, Magneto is alive once again, and on the run with Cyclops, who has just killed Professor Xavier in his own powerdunk haze. This is about the fifth time Professor X has died. He’ll be back. And yes, I know that Marvel explained that the New York event was yet another a “fake” Magneto, who was killed at the end of it. But even for comics, that’s absurd. Howe, <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779265805' target='_blank'><i>Marvel Comics</i></a>, pp. 412-413, 423, 468."

A final thought: Howe includes an anecdote both funny and moving, in which the writer Steve Gerber “rescued” the Marvel-owned character that he created, Howard the Duck, by having another character in an independent “snatch” him from a crowd. Marvel still owns Howard the Duck, of course, but it was a powerful statement.<br /><br />When is copyright infringement like the Underground Railroad?"
