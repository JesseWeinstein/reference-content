It was scarcely organized or maintained, but already it drew a trickle of visitors. This was a West that was not yet “won,” however, and the U.S. Cavalry’s war against the Native Americans was still underway. That summer, nine Yellowstone tourists were entangled in the violence when hundreds of Nez Perce warriors swept through the park, hoping to reach Canada.",

The following story is excerpted from Schweber’s chapter on Nez Perce Creek, for which he tracked down historical records—including an unpublished first-hand account of what happened to two of those tourists, the Cowans, in 1877. All direct quotes attributed to George Cowan in the excerpt that follows come from a transcript of the story that George Cowan dictated to his daughter Ethel in April 1920. It’s a reminder of what Yellowstone was before it was a park, and what the U.S. government ended to make it that way.",

These trout flushed up and down the watershed and, in the next few decades, were bolstered by additional brown, rainbow, and brook trout stocked throughout the Firehole, Gibbon and Madison River systems. The result was that by the time Emma Cowan died in 1939 these rivers were all great sportfisheries, but their native Westslope cutthroat trout, which she delighted in catching and eating in the days before her capture, were either exterminated, hybridized or pushed into just a few tiny, inhospitable headwater streams where no other trout lived.
