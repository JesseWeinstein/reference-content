      "content": "In April, 1612, the constables of Calne, Wiltshire, made a desperate plea to their superiors—the county magistrates—to help them reverse a surge in the number of alehouses in their town. Their complaint was that the alehouses “doe all brewe and vie who maye brewe the strongest Ale and thither do resorte all the great drinkers bothe of the Towne and Countrie to spende theyer tyme in idleness and theyer monie in excessivie drinkinge.” When the constables sought to discourage such behavior by charging the men involved with drunkenness, their efforts were unsuccessful, for “all men for the most parte love these cupp companions so well, that no man will take uppon him to be a sworne witnes against any drunkard.”",

Even the most astute pioneers of cultural history saw it as an inevitable product of life in unstable and harsh worlds, in which people drank heavily to “blot out the horror of their lives.” In this interpretation, drink served as an anesthetic against an oppressive and tedious existence.",

These were songs printed on a single sheet of paper and sold cheaply for a penny by sellers who recited them in the streets and in alehouses. There were millions of these sheets in circulation; the staple subjects for the songs included courtship and marriage, affairs of state, sensational murders, chivalric adventures, and moral guidance. Best of all from the perspective of the historian of drinking cultures, one particularly popular genre was the “Drinking and Good Fellowship” ballad. These were drinking songs designed to be recited in the alehouse, and many alehouse-keepers pasted them up on the walls to attract drinkers to their establishment.",

It gives us a sense of how the tunes were simple and catchy, designed as much as a mnemonic device as an aesthetic one. It may also assist imaginative efforts to hear the lone-voice of a ballad singer in the street—though even for this purpose it is perhaps too polished, as one seventeenth-century writer complained that ballad sellers’ voices tended to be “as harsh a noise as ever Cart-wheel made.” It certainly doesn’t capture the atmosphere we would expect to accompany an alehouse ballad performance, for which we might imagine background noise, rhythmic hand-clapping, and massed voices for the chorus.",

Drumming might be heard, as it was in Glastonbury’s Ship Inn one night in 1657, when a gentleman who had planned to lodge with a friend there overnight had a change of heart due to the presence of “a disorderly company ranting and drinking and drumming,” who “beat the drum all night [such] that the neighbors were much disturbed and could not sleep.” In another raucous drinking bout in a 1609 Cheshire alehouse, one drinker repeatedly blasted a trumpet to “call together all the drunkards.”",

      "content": "The sound of a drinking song is likely then to have been much more vibrant and boisterous than the sound evoked by listening (alone at a desk) to the recordings offered by the English Broadside Ballad Archive, however innovative a resource they are. There are other problems here, of course, that even an attempt to create a recording that more closely evoked an alehouse atmosphere would not overcome. One is that a ballad would not only have been sung or listened to—it would have been a performance to be _seen_ as well. A wink or a nod to accompany certain lines, or a sideways glance or grin at a drinking companion, could have transformed the meanings of the lines being delivered, something which will forever be lost to the historian.",

Even if we replace the practice of sitting quietly at a desk reading a ballad with sitting at a desk listening to a recording of a ballad and trying hard to imagine drums, trumpets, and raucous merriment, the average historian (one would expect) is still going to be sober. The drinking song experience was not. A beer at lunchtime might help, but the levels of intoxication that would accompany the drinking song experience might again exert considerable influence on a song’s meaning, as humor and camaraderie become enhanced and exaggerated.",

Again, ballad scholars have not ignored this, and efforts have been made at various ballad conferences to try to create a performative atmosphere through collective singing, sometimes with alcohol involved. I haven’t yet had this experience myself—though I will at a conference next spring—but I already have one major reservation (other than being hopeless at singing) about what this can achieve. A group of academics closely analyzing every aspect of the dynamics is hardly likely to create an authentic or natural atmosphere: the whole thing is likely to be too self-conscious.",

      "content": "How, then, can the historian intent on ‘hearing’ their source material get closer to doing so? I’m not sure we can, but if the answer lies anywhere then I’m fairly sure it cannot be found at my desk. Arguably my greatest insight into the experience of the seventeenth-century drinking song came not from a recording, nor any sort of forced imaginative effort. It came when attending a recent English football match. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow supporters of Bristol City, I heard the slow, repetitive beat of a drum, and a lone voice projecting the words to a familiar exhortation of our team’s quality.",

It was, admittedly, an almost exclusively masculine experience, but this too had echoes of many an alehouse drinking bout of the seventeenth century.",

Yet it seemed there were greater parallels between these two experiences than there were between some of my more detached academic attempts to ‘hear’ the songs of the past and how those songs were actually experienced. I’m generally wary of letting personal experience stand in for historical knowledge based on a reading of source material, but when we try to recover aspects of the past that no amount of _reading_ can achieve, we have to open our minds to approaches that transcend the more conventionally academic.",
