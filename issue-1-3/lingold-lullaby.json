    "summary": "A Georgia woman shares a lullaby sung to her by her black nurse with the poet Carl Sandburg. Sandburg transcribes it, gives it the cringe-worthy title of “Jungle Mammy Song.” Can we sing it, today, and hear the nurse who first gave it life, the racial meanings it accrued put on mute? Mary Caton Lingold challenges us to sing and hear our way into even the hardest histories."

It has long been common for white authors to denigrate and laud black music culture in the same breath. Many of the earliest accounts of Afro-Atlantic musical practices include this type of reckless and self-important ambivalence. Seemingly uncomfortable with all that the term “jungle mammy” implies, Sandburg wades into sexist territory while addressing the derogatory title by reassuring readers that “all mothers are primitive and earthly even though civilized and celestial.”",

But rather than focusing strictly on the ways in which the image of the “negro woman” who sang this tune was degraded in Sandburg’s introduction and attending cultural norms, I want to ask whether this imperfect, highly mediated artifact bears witness to her experience, history, and voice.

What other musical practices did she participate in? As a researcher, I would love to verify that the song was originally authored or transmitted by a newly enslaved person or from an established slave culture, since both scenarios would strengthen the song’s ties to early Afro-diasporic musical practices.

Bluegrass is one of many music traditions that prides itself on a dependence on aural transmission.

Also, by encountering the song through a multi-vocal recording, we can lift it off the page and back into the realm of the vernacular. Though I don’t wish to overstate the distinction between the two modes or to romanticize the one over the other, my point is that the media through which we encounter music makes a strong impression on our understanding of it.

It may be that knowing her song means simply that, to know it. Listening is often understood as a means to receive rather than perceive information. (“I hear you” and “I’m listening” come across a bit differently than “I see what you mean.”) By staging opportunities to listen to historical performances, we can mobilize both our fields of perception _and_ reception. Emphasizing auditory culture also helps us to engage with historical actors who did not author their own narratives in print as subjects rather than as simple objects of history. The song, then, is not a portal into an understanding of a particular woman’s story, but an opportunity to witness something that her voice made known. Rather than repackaging the music and its creator like Sandburg did, this time, I’d rather just listen.",

The _American Songbag_ is emblematic of his curiosity about diverse traditions across the United States (he traveled widely as an orator) as well as the evolving appetites for homegrown music in the country at large. For more about his life and work, see the recent PBS American Masters documentary, _The Day Carl Sandburg Died_ (2012).",
        "The title of the tune recalls “coon songs” that popularized racist stereotypes and mythologies of African-American music. These representations were complicated because they denigrated black music and lauded it at the same time. Undoubtedly influenced by the music created by enslaved people and their descendants, coon songs were sometimes authored and performed by African-Americans. This song’s title nods to the genre, whose popularity was waning around the time that Carl Sandburg published the _American Songbag_ in 1927. For further reading on coon songs and the ragtime era and their connection to (and departure from) both white and black minstrelsy, see Lynn Abbot and Doug Seroff, [_Ragged but Right: Black Traveling Shows, “Coon Songs,” and the Dark Pathway to Blues and Jazz_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68416847) (Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2007)."

        "When you ask for help learning a tune, you will never hear someone suggest that you purchase a book of sheet music and learn it. They _will_ recommend that you listen to famous recordings or that you learn new tunes directly from another player. This is also true in jazz circles, where sheet music and charts play an important role, but are nearly eclipsed by an emphasis on recording history and classic interpretations. I find it telling that we “learn by ear” rather than learn by _listening._ No one would ever say that they learn sheet music “by seeing.” The subtle implication is that learning by ear is somehow natural, and thereby less studied. I can assure you that it takes a lot of work to be able to learn music by ear efficiently."
