In _The Appendix_’s [previous editorial letter](http://theappendix.net/issues/2013/4/issue-two-letter-from-the-editors), for instance, we wrote about “seeing history in our minds’ eyes, listening for its voices, hearing its music.”",

      "content": "What we see and hear are _records_ of past events—never the real thing. We might find a metaphor in the Greek bronzes whose inlaid eyes of ruby, ivory, or obsidian have been replaced by empty sockets. Though the dead leave material traces in the frozen faces of statues, in the words in books, or the ghostly voices on LPs, perhaps the act of recording failed to capture something fundamental about their souls. What is true of the statues might be true of every past life: we can never really look them in the eye. And we can never hear their voice.",

For the naturalist **Bernie Krause**, the [history of sound begins](#1) before the evolution of _Homo sapiens_, when our ancestors first developed a sonic vocabulary of proto-language and proto-music by imitating birdsong and other forms of “biophony” (a [concept anticipated](#2) by **Charles Darwin**). Taking myth as an alternate starting point, **John Franklin and Glynnis Fawkes** [offer a visual history](#3) of a legendary lyre-player from Ancient Cyprus who brought music to humanity, while **Will Buckingham** [re-imagines the Orphic legend](#4) in Bulgaria. Other pieces zoom in to discover histories of sound on a scale both miniature and momentous: **Michael Schmidt**, for instance, [reflects](#5) on a father’s sonic record of his daughter’s childhood.",

And moving to 1980s San Francisco, **Chris Smith** ponders what happens when a band that forged its persona in a tiny musical subculture [tries to move beyond its roots](#3).",

Several of our pieces explore the interstices of song, religion, and identity. **Glenda Goodman** [writes about a Puritan minister kidnapped](#1) by  Indian and French raiders whose memories of Psalms were what held him together as his life collapsed around him—and whose musical prejudices led him to vilify the French Catholics who tried to convert him even more than his native captors. Moving across the Atlantic to Africa, **Danielle Skeehan** shows us how [songs helped newly-captured slaves](#2) retain their identities in the holds of the Middle Passage.",

Human-created melodies, after all, are just a tiny outcrop on a vast glacier of sound: from the beating of our own hearts in our chests to the inarticulate calls of animals, most of what we hear is not music, but noise. **Jonathan Meiburg** takes us to [the half-hidden Hall of Birds in the American Museum of Natural History](#1), where living birdsong has been replaced by silent, stuffed mementos. **Timothy Fulford** writes about the [haunting sounds of the Arctic Circle](#2), where early nineteenth-century Europeans found that human voices were transformed by natural phenomena they didn’t understand, and by the seemingly miraculous powers of Inuit shamans. And **Rachel Ozanne** brings us [a history not of sound, but of its absence](#3).",
