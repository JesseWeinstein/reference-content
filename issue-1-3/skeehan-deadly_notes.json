As Cereno tells how sickness and maritime misadventure depleted the crew and battered the ship, the “cymballing of the hatchet-polishers” continues to punctuate the narrative, and Delano wonders why “why such an interruption should be allowed, especially in that part of the ship, and in the ears of an invalid.”",

The apparent disorder was, in fact, not disorder at all: rather it was a highly orchestrated “operatic” performance that staged the relationship between free and enslaved—European and New World African—precisely as Delano expected to _see_ it.",

In the words of a sailor on board the Liverpool slave trader, the _Hubridas_, in 1786, enslaved men and women raised their voices in “a kind of chorus” that resounded “at the close of particular sentences.” The sailor’s use of the term “chorus” is worth noting. A chorus consists of individual voices coming together to produce a collective, synchronized voice, and in theatrical traditions the chorus served as commentary on dramatic action. These call and response soundings allowed men and women speaking different languages to communicate about the conditions of their captivity. In fact, on board the _Hubridas_, what began as murmurs and morphed into song erupted before long into the shouts and cries of coordinated revolt. In the words of another sailor, “what [was] the subject of their songs [I] cannot say.”",

At the surface, the slave trade’s systematic documentation—in the form of ship’s logs, insurance documents, sales records, account books, and published journals—appears to record the erasure and suppression of African voices, cultures, and resistance. But, like Captain Delano, I wonder if there may be something in these records that we have failed _to hear_. By understanding the writing of the Middle Passage as an early audio technology—rather than simply a history of exploitation—we can think about sound as a new language of resistance perhaps particular to pathways of the Middle Passage and _embedded_ in the writing itself. In these accounts the deadly _notes_ of an enslaved cargo communicating and acting in mass regularly interrupt the deadly _marks_ of the official record. Maritime writing thus records the conditions of the Middle Passage from two perspectives: the calculated master narrative at the surface of the record, and the sounds that erupt from the depths.",

Yarra!” [We are sick] and “Kickeraboo! Kickeraboo!” [we are dying]. And Joseph Hawkins dramatizes voices and bodies staged for revolt as enslaved men and women in the hold “set up a scream,” “shouting whenever those above did any thing that appeared likely” to overturn the order of the ship.",

Cugoano repeatedly acknowledges that these experiences are beyond what “language can describe,” and his passage into slavery also suggests a passage into an Atlantic soundscape defined by the _voices_ of the enslaved—rather than the _written_ record of captors.",

Sound, in the words of Saidiya Hartman, could be said to “topple the hierarchy of discourse, and … engulf authorized speech in the clash of voices”—or, as in _Benito Cereno_, the clash of hatchets. That is, the sound produced by New World Africans may represent a counterclaim to political enfranchisement and may provide another model of political process. The combined record of noise and revolt suggests that cargoes of captive men and women speaking a number of different languages and dialects who began their journey to ships coasting off the shores of Western Africa from vastly different regions and cultures began to communicate with each other and to act en masse.",

Since 2002, eight major cities—Berkeley, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Oakland, Philadelphia, and San Francisco—and three states—California, Iowa, and Illinois—have passed slavery disclosure laws. Disclosure laws belong to a history of movements to secure reparations for slavery: they require companies to research and then disclose any ties that these companies or their predecessors had to slavery. The focus on _disclosure_—on opening up that which was closed or shut, on unclosing, unfolding, and unfastening contemporary economic and historical ties to the slave trade—points to a history that will not be silenced.",

        "Melville’s novella is a fictionalized retelling of events that happened off the coast of Santa Maria, a small, uninhabited island off the coast of Chile, on February 20, 1805. The American sea captain, Amasa Delano, had anchored _The Perseverance_ there while they were restocking water supplies on their return journey from Canton. While there, a rather battered and weather beaten Spanish merchant ship soon sailed into harbor and appeared to be in distress. Assessing the situation, Delano decided to approach _The Tryal_ and offer his services. In Delano’s published account of what followed, he notes, “As soon as I got on deck, the captain, mate, people and slaves, crowded around me to relate their stories, and to make known their grievances” (p. 322). Delano was on board _The Tryal_ for the greater part of the day, and relates very little else until—at his departure—the Captain of the ship—Benito Cereno—jumps overboard and informs Delano that he had been audience to an elaborate performance carried off by the enslaved Africans on board the ship, that they had revolted, and that Cereno himself was, in fact, their captive. The events are related in three prior written accounts (as well as numerous North American newspapers): the ship’s log recounting that day’s events, the Lima court records, and Delano’s _Narrative of Voyages and Travels in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres_ (Boston 1817). Herman Melville’s _Benito Cereno_ (first published in 1855 in _Putnam’s Monthly_) takes up the challenge of imagining and recreating the holes in Delano’s narrative and invites us to consider why such an elaborate drama was excluded from the record in the first place. The additional narratives are reproduced in Delano’s _Narrative_, available [here](http://books.google.com/books/about/Narrative_of_voyages_and_travels_in_the.html?id=yq8BAAAAYAAJ)."

In _Saltwater Slavery_, Smallwood examines how ships’ logs, captains’ journals, sales records and a litany of texts connected to the trade develop a discourse about race and slavery. See Stephanie Smallwood, [_Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/67361507) (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007). In _Specters of the Atlantic_, Baucom, in turn, argues that African captives were interpolated not only into a British slave trade, but into the systems of credit that they in turn helped to support. Examining the trials that resulted when the captain of the Zong murdered 131 of the Africans on board his ship, Baucom argues for how insurance documents transformed captive bodies into capital or credit.

Or a past bleached from our minds. It means finding the art forms of those of our ancestors and speaking in the patois forbidden us. It means realizing our knowledge will always be wanting.

        "R. Murray Schafer defines the concept of “soundscapes” as sonic environments that provide an opening for scholars to consider “the enculturated nature of sound…and the material spaces of performance that are constructed for the purpose of propagating sound.” See [_The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28711078) (Merrimac, MA: Destiny, 1993). See also Mark M. Smith’s essay “Listening to the Heard Worlds of Antebellum America,” _Journal of The Historical Society_ (June 2000): 63-97. Smith invites early American scholars, in particular, to think about how sound can serve as an “index of identity.” Similarly, Richard Rath’s 2003 book-length study, [_How Early America Sounded_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53013074) (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2005), attends to sound as a way to “open up parts of these worlds, not to get a glimpse of them but to listen in.” Most recently, [_American Quarterly_](http://www.americanquarterly.org/) published a special issue on sound studies in September 2011 and just this past February [_Commonplace_](http://www.common-place.org/) released an issue on music and Early America."
