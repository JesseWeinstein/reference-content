The players, having previously stripped themselves quite naked, and put on a pair of wide breeches reaching no lower than the knee, step forth to the sound of the music into the middle of the arena; and then their gymnastic exercises begin in the following manner: They first all place themselves in a row on their heads and feet, and endeavour by stretchings and distortions of the body, during which some times the most indecent postures occur, to rend every part thereof more pliant. They all at once jump up, form a circle, hold one foot up, and hop round in a circle on the other, whilst with both hands they incessantly strike their thighs. After this they alter their position, so that, instead of going round in a circle, they hop in a straight line from one end of the arena to the other, either across or lengthwise, and as often as they approach the wall, they beat time to the music by striking backwards with one of their feet a board leaning against it …",
