    "summary": "Hidden behind the American Museum of Natural History's fluttering butterfly exhibit, lie the time-machine traces of an earlier still-life paean to creatures of the air: the Whitney Hall of Oceanic Birds. Its beautiful dioramas—of frigate birds tracing the bow of the ship that collected them early in the twentieth century, a long-extinct New Zealand moa, resurrected with feathers and wire—are trapped in glass, the songless lovesong of the men and women who pinned them together. Shearwater's Jonathan Meiburg takes us behind their wings."

It commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of the museum’s Whitney Wing “and its two public exhibitions, the Whitney Hall of Oceanic Birds and the Sanford Hall of Bird Life, which have enlightened millions of students, scholars, and visitors from around the world and will continue to be sources of knowledge and enjoyment for generations to come.”",

The Sanford hall was dismantled in 1999 to make room for an expansion of the planetarium, and the Whitney hall’s fate is ambiguous: like an abandoned subway station, it can be glimpsed, but is mostly hidden. Ten of its eighteen dioramas are concealed behind the conservatory’s cocoon-shaped enclosure, where live tropical butterflies land on visitors’ heads and outstretched fingers.",

      "content": "The Whitney hall was once one of the crown jewels of the museum, alongside the halls of African and North American mammals, and like them it was a reminder of a time when the museum pushed the boundaries of dioramas as educational objects and as art. Over the years, even as range maps and species names have become outdated, the art has remained potent; the mammal halls’ dioramas retain an eerie, sublime power.   At their best they seem deeply and strangely alive. The Hall of North American Mammals was lovingly restored and reopened in 2012, and the numinous indoor courtyard of the African hall, whose dark-paneled galleries surround a parading family of elephants, remains the museum’s literal and figurative centerpiece. But of the three halls, the Whitney might have been the most ambitious, if not quite in grandeur, then at least in scope. Oceanic birds were its alleged focus, but its true aim was to create “the Pacific in microcosm,” cramming the landscapes, seascapes, and feathered wildlife of nearly half the globe—all Oceania—into one room.",

Sanford, a deep-pocketed New Haven surgeon with an ornithology habit. Chapman arrived at the museum as a volunteer in 1887 and didn’t retire until 1942, at age 78. He more or less acquired Sanford along the way: in 1912, Chapman convinced him to store his personal collection of bird skins at the museum and installed him in an office next to Chapman’s as an unofficial member of the staff.",

It was a golden age for field ornithology; steamships, railroads, and the fledgling automobile had made the world newly accessible, but vast regions remained unsurveyed. Sanford’s first major effort was a marine expedition to collect shorebirds and seabirds around the coast of South America, a huge job that would take years to complete.  After persuading a museum trustee to help fund the project, Sanford hired an unusually gifted Californian bird collector named Rollo Beck to see it through.",

He pioneered the technique of “chumming” for seabirds, tossing oily bits of meat and offal from the boat as he drifted with the current, then rowing back and picking off the birds that collected to scavenge on the slick. This technique amazed Beck’s companions, who couldn’t understand how he could so confidently set out to bag seabirds where there weren’t any to be seen, but he knew from experience that seabirds can detect food from miles away just as turkey vultures do on land – with a keen sense of smell. Beck’s wife, Ida, who often accompanied him on collecting trips, sometimes waited for him on the shores of Monterey Bay until well after dark.",

They seem to be sharing a private joke with the photographer; Ida smiles warmly and Rollo, wearing an impish expression, looms like a Cheshire Cat out of the darkness of the hold to her left.  Another image from the same day, taken by Rollo, shows a gracefully posed Ida reading _The Ladies’ Home Journal_ on deck with a young gentoo penguin by her side.  Three days later, Ida appears perched on a cliff, gazing toward the famous silhouette of Cape Horn.  It looks like a good place to be in the second year of the First World War.",

Like his friend Walter Rothschild in England, Sanford wanted a complete “series” of bird skins from each island, even where species were duplicated, to create a picture not only of what birds existed in the world, but exactly where they were, reflecting a growing scientific interest in small geographical variations among related species. Nowhere were these variations more pronounced than among island birds, and nowhere were there more islands than in the Pacific—some twenty to thirty thousand—many of them never surveyed by ornithologists. Sanford wasn’t deterred by the fact that these islands were spread over an area almost as large as all the world’s land masses combined.",

They also contended with an infestation of cockroaches and the smells of what was basically a floating abattoir. “It was not,” one participant [recalled](http://www.webofstories.com/play/ernst.mayr/13;jsessionid=DE20191840D68B3A836CD32DEC1CBC09), “a glorious expedition in any sense of the word.”  Added to all this was the danger of visiting islands whose residents might not welcome strange foreigners.

(The Becks, possibly out of exasperation with the Ivy League boys the museum kept sending them as field assistants, left the expedition after nine years and traveled on their own to Australia and New Guinea, where Rollo discovered a new species of bowerbird.)",

Sanford asked the Whitneys to fund the construction of an entire new wing of the museum, purpose-built to house and display its overflowing bird collection.  The wing would also include two permanent exhibit halls, one of which would showcase the birds of the Whitney expedition and their home islands, bringing the distant worlds of the Pacific—previously known best to the public from the works of Gauguin and Melville—to Manhattan.",

In 1931, Mayr accepted a post at the museum, where he began the mammoth job of describing and analyzing its growing backlog of bird skins. Many of the specimens were new to science, and Mayr drew on the incredible breadth of the expedition’s collection and his own field experiences as the basis for his still-definitive list of the birds of New Guinea and his landmark [Systematics and the Origin of Species](http://books.google.com/books/about/Systematics_and_the_Origin_of_Species.html?id=mAIjnLp6r_MC) (1942), which essentially created the modern field of evolutionary biology.",

Hidden inside were the landscapes and birds of Fiji, Papua, the snowy peaks of western New Guinea, wind-blasted Little Diomede (a tiny spot of land in the Bering Sea), and the shores of the Great Barrier Reef.  Piles of cardboard boxes choked the corridor, an antique Underwood typewriter rested against the wall, and a decades-old can of Schaefer beer was tucked behind a railing.  Capainolo nodded toward a ladder that ascended into darkness near the doorway. “There’s a little platform up there that’d be a good place to take a nap,” he said. “You go up there, nobody’ll find you.”",

They’re also the stars, he added, of the film on butterfly migration showing downstairs in the IMAX theatre. The monarchs, their folded underwings the pale brown of dead leaves, were North American, but their cellmates were cosmopolitan: bouncing against the lights or uncurling their tongues to drink condensation from the walls, they hailed from the Amazon, East Africa, Malaysia.

Though the most colorful birds are slightly faded after sixty years on display, the scenes remain remarkably fresh and real: Samoa’s lorikeets, honey-eaters and fruit-doves blithely perch in view of a concealed barn owl, the yellow-crested penguins of the Snares nest in a weird forest of tree daisies, and elegant, wave-hugging cape petrels and prions soar over the bow of the _France_.",

        "It’s worth a word, here, about study skins. Birds are unusual among animals in that their feathers give them their distinctive shapes; unfeathered, most birds more or less resemble a plucked turkey. So it’s possible to preserve the shape and plumage of a freshly-killed bird with a sort of shorthand field taxidermy. Turning a bird into a ‘skin’ (which, unless there’s a freezer handy, has to be done within a few hours of its death) involves opening its abdomen with a vertical incision, removing nearly all of its muscles and viscera (including the brain, which can be drawn from the skull by gently turning the neck inside-out), stuffing the body cavity with straw or cotton batting, and stitching it back up, leaving the beak, feet, wings, tail, and overall form of the living bird intact.  In the hand, these skins have a faintly talismanic power; they evoke not just the animal they once were, but [the time and place in which they were collected](http://theappendix.net/issues/2013/4/from-the-aviary-haliaeetus-leucocephalus). Rollo and Ida Beck’s skills in preparing these skins in the field were exceptional, and even now, you can usually spot a Beck skin in a drawer of specimens without looking at the ID tag. They’re clean, artful, and remarkably uniform, and it’s hard to imagine them being prepared at sea, much less in a rowboat."

        "Shortly after construction began on the Whitney Wing, the museum received a dramatic windfall in the form of a letter to Sanford from Walter Rothschild, offering to sell his globally representative collection of 280,000 bird skins to the American Museum.  The sale was made, with funds provided (again) by the Whitneys. At the time, Sanford was led to believe that Rothschild had sold his collection for tax reasons, but Rothschild’s niece Miriam revealed in a 1983 biography of her uncle that the cause of the sale was blackmail: Rothschild’s former mistress, a “charming, witty, aristocratic, ruthless” woman, “who, aided and abetted by her husband … ruined him financially, destroyed his piece of mind for forty years and eventually forced him to sell his bird collection.” Miriam Rothschild, [_Dear Lord Rothschild: birds, butterflies, and history_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9557941) (London: Hutchinson, 1983)."
