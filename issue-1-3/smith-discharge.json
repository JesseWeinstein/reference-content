The fans hated it so much that their disastrous show in San Francisco left the lead singer in tears. But was it their fault—or the fault of an audience that wanted punk trapped in amber?"

        "I grew up loving punk and metal in suburban Detroit in the 1980s, and I sang in a hardcore band. We generally played as fast as possible, and everything we did tended toward entropy. Most of our songs collapsed in on themselves in the end, as people cursed and pounded on walls and threw things across the room.<br /><br />\nMostly we played our own juvenile compositions, but we also covered Black Flag’s “Gimme Gimme Gimme.” Our version wasn’t any good, but it seemed conceivable that if we practiced enough, it could be one day. The song had plenty of breathing room, gaps between notes and beats. It was approachable. I loved Discharge, but it never occurred to me to suggest playing any of its songs. Discharge was monolithic, too dense and dark, somehow, for our half-assed homage."

        "All D-Beat might sound the same to the uninitiated, but Discharge’s heirs come in many different flavors. In addition to the sonic and graphic mimicry, many D-Beat bands have named themselves by adding the prefix “Dis” to an astonishing variety of words—a sort of hardcore Mad Libs. Some, such as Disrupt, actually make sense. Others, like Disrape, are utterly nonsensical and probably tongue-in-cheek. See the videos in this paragraph for some examples."
