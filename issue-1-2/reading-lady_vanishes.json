        "summary": "Before writing _The Wizard of Oz_, L. Frank Baum supposedly concocted a department store window display in which a torso-less woman appeared and re-appeared, each time wearing a different woman’s hat. Or did he? Amy Reading finds that male window dressers of Baum’s day thought they were luring in female buyers with their elaborate displays—but they enchanted themselves instead."

There she is on a bustling city street in Chicago, a live model in a window display, unembarrassed by her missing half or the staring eyes of the pedestrians before her. Whether it is her absent torso and limbs or the fetching hat on her dark curls, she draws quite a crowd. Then, slowly, unaccountably, she vanishes into the floor. The crowd holds its breath. When she rises back up into view, she is wearing a new hat, but she is also covered in theory. Just dripping with it.",

When he surges through the crowd and enters the department store, perhaps you too are tempted to cross the threshold and see what other wonders are displayed inside this new temple of commerce.

Frank Baum when he was a pioneering window dresser and the founder of a trade journal for the new profession called _The Show Window_, just before he wrote the book that would make him famous, _The Wizard of Oz_. Baum’s “vanishing lady” combined two innovations—a live model and a motorized stand—to entice passers-by in the modern city. As a spectacle, the window was a roaring success: so many people thronged to see the vanishing lady that the store was compelled to install an iron bar to keep the glass from cracking. As an advertisement, however, the window’s success is vexingly unknown: the whole point of the display was to sell hats, and sales data has not been preserved.",

Baum’s display has become the most famous show window of its time, enthralling viewers to this day with its usefulness (often in combination with _The Wizard of Oz_) for the critical theory of gender, spectatorship, and consumer culture. The truncated woman is, most obviously, a symbol of the fate of women in the hands of a patriarchal culture, which puts them on a pedestal at a terrible cost. Or she is the relay in a smooth process that transformed the Victorian woman from a private homebody staring at herself in a mirror, to a public, consuming creature, searching for herself on the cinema screen. The vanishing lady also symbolizes the return of the repressed; she is an “agent provocateur” who subverts the ease with which “the casual shopper [could] lose herself in fantastic identifications with the female image on display … not least because that image keeps evading her.” Instead of seeing an idealized, hyper-fashionable version of herself in Baum’s Chicago show window, the casual shopper sees “a critical presence” who points to all the disfigured and absent bodies produced by modernity.",

The photo originally appeared in Baum’s trade journal in 1898, accompanying an article by the window’s designer, Chas. W. Morton, who invented the display for the Weinstock, Lubin & Co. department store in Sacramento, California, where he was the head window trimmer.  It turns out that the “Vanishing Lady” show window speaks far less about some strange wizard behind the scenes, rubbing his hands together in glee as he designs the next way to oppress the masses, than it does about modern consumption as an anxious, experimental project.",

When Weinstock’s opened their new store at K Street and Fourth Street in 1891, he designed a grand window scene, in which the floor would open to reveal a slowly rising and unfolding rose. Out of the rose would step a little girl, who would flit about the window with a fairy wand, trying on hats and other merchandise, before returning to her flower to be enclosed and lowered back into the floor. Three times a day for a week she repeated her performance, and the crowds were as enthusiastic as they would later be for the “vanishing lady” display in 1898. When Morton won the diamond medal for best display at the national convention of window trimmers the next year, perhaps it was the “vanishing lady” who elevated him above his East-coast peers. Morton’s avant-garde windows were a contrast to the “new” store within, where customers still sat on stools at long wooden counters to wait while salespeople brought them merchandise for inspection. The evolution of consumer culture was far from even.",

In London, she prettily folded her hands over her lace handkerchief. He would then cover her with a giant black silk cloth, long enough to obscure her body but transparent enough to keep her visible. He would take a few moments to arrange it around the folds of her dress and tie it behind her head. And then, with a flick of the wrist, he would whisk the silk off. A lace handkerchief would be all that remained on the empty chair. Even the silk in his hands would be gone.

Four scholars in particular—Joseph Jastrow, one of the founders of the American Psychological Association, Max Dessoir, Norman Triplett, and Alfred Binet—brought stage magicians into their laboratories to film their prestidigitations, and what they discovered is that the more the mind knows itself, the longer the list of ways it can be deceived.  Magicians used the very principles of empiricism to misdirect the audience’s gaze. The psychologists of deception theorized that this susceptibility was inevitable and insurmountable. Triplett wryly noted that, “fixed mental habits, evolved for useful purposes, to avoid being surprised and deceived, are the very agents employed by the conjurer to effect this end.”",

                "The late nineteenth-century saw a radical transformation in the way goods were bought and sold in American cities. The department stores that evolved from dry goods stores in the 1870s and 1880s were enabled, first of all, by technological innovations like cast-iron architecture and the manufacture of large sheets of plate glass, which allowed for dramatic exteriors, and interiors with high ceilings and unbroken expanses of display space.<br /><br />Inside these grand halls, store managers could stock an unprecedented variety of goods, and they revised traditional methods of negotiating a sale in order to turn over this stock faster. Instead of storing their goods in cabinets behind counters, to be pulled out and haggled over with each customer, department stores arrayed their goods in full view and gave each item a single fixed price. Customers were now free to enter department stores without the obligation to buy.<br /><br />The first few decades of the department store saw a myriad of other innovations to the business of retailing—including the acceptance of returns, more flexible buying patterns from wholesalers which resulted in greater economies of scale and better discounts for customers, the creation of departments within department stores, and concessions to customers’ comfort in the form of lounges, restaurants, free lectures, delivery services, and day care. But the most revolutionary change was the creation of an atmosphere of browsing. Rachel Bowlby describes the new mode of selling as a twin process of reinvention: </p><blockquote>In the shift to consumer capitalism, then, modern commerce engages in a curiously double enterprise. On the one hand, a process of rationalization: the transformation of selling into an industry. The department stores are organized like factories, with hundreds of workers, shareholding companies, vast turnovers, and careful calculation of continual strategies of expansion. On the other hand, the transformation of industry into a shop window. This massive and revolutionary extension of scope is achieved by the association of commerce with ideological values that seem to be diametrically opposed to the mundane actuality of work, profits and rationality. The grands magasins, like the great exhibitions, appear as places of culture, fantasy, divertissement, which the customer visits more for pleasure than necessity.</blockquote><p>By 1890, these structural foundations of modern consumption were in place, and department store managers now sought new ways to fill their wide aisles with enough customers to make profitable their expensive services. If department store managers previously focused their energies on providing the best and least expensive products to suit consumers’ needs, after 1890 they increasingly turned their resources toward convincing consumers to desire more than what they strictly needed.<br /><br />On the transformation from dry goods emporiums to department stores, see Susan Porter Benson, <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12557301' target='_blank'><i>Counter Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American Department Stores, 1890-1940</i></a> (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1986), 13-74; William Leach, <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26929898' target='_blank'><i>Land of Desire: Merchants, Power, and the Rise of a New American Culture</i></a> (New York: Vintage Books, 1993), 15-150; and Elaine Abelson, <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19623873' target='_blank'><i>When Ladies Go A’Thieving: Middle-Class Shoplifters in the Victorian Department Store</i></a> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 13-41.

Its very success was its ruin, so transcendent was it in mystification. The effect of the trick upon the spectator, the first time he sees it, is nothing short of marvellous. The performer brings forward a lady to the front of the stage, seats her upon a chair in full view of the spectators, spreads over her a piece of filmy silk, so gauzy that the outlines of her figure may be discerned through it, and while she is in this position he whisks off the silk. The chair is there; the lady has vanished.<br /><br />“The explanatory details of this wonderful trick, which are now known by every tyro in the profession, would weary rather than instruct. I have often experimented with the trick myself as a curiosity. Suffice it to say that the elaborate mechanical operations necessary for its production would almost build a locomotive, and yet they are exhausted in a hundred springs and bolts of steel working like the springs of a watch and all cooperating, with the aid of a confederate working through a trap-door under the stage.”"

                "The psychologists agree with the magicians that a spectator’s attempt to penetrate the illusion will always fail. “If you know how a conjurer causes a dollar to disappear, you know nothing, and you will be deceived hundreds of times by this same trick,” Dessoir writes in “<a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24191161' target='_blank'>Psychology of the Art of Conjuring</a>,” pp. 137-8. “What makes prestidigitation the art of deception is not the technical outward appearance, but the psychological kernel.”<br /><br />Dessoir and Jastrow both discover that kernel lodged in the space between two fundamental rules of stage magic: never tell an audience beforehand what you are about to do, and really do first that which you want the audience to believe you have done later. So, for instance, when making a ball disappear in midair, the magician should not announce that the ball will disappear on the fourth toss, but should straightforwardly toss the ball into the air three times before palming it and only pantomiming the fourth toss—most audiences will report that they saw the ball leave the magician’s hand only to vanish on the way up.<br /><br />Jastrow explains in “The Psychology of Deception,” published in the December 1888 issue of <i>The Popular Science Monthly</i>, that this misperception is because “we are creatures of the average; we are adjusted for the most probable event; our organism has acquired the habits impressed upon it by the most frequent repetitions; and this has induced an inherent logical necessity to interpret a new experience by the old, an unfamiliar by the familiar” (p. 147). The magician effectively prevents the audience from making their own inference about what will happen and instead implants a false inference.<br /><br />Dessoir notes two basic principles of perception that magicians manipulate in order to substitute their own suggestions. The first is association: to create the impression that he has opened a paper bag, the magician need merely create the snapping sound that we associate with the action. The second is imitation: to divert attention from the manipulations of his left hand, the magician need merely gaze hypnotically at the wand in his right hand for the audience to do the same. (The paper bag example comes from Jim Steinmeyer, <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53221208' target='_blank'><i>Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible and Learned to Disappear</i></a> (New York: Carroll & Graf, 2003), p. 117.)<br /><br />Dessoir might well have pointed out that these principles resemble John Stuart Mills’s laws of the mind as he enumerated them in <a href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60718632' target='_blank'><i>A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive</i></a>. Specifically, laws such as “when two impressions have been frequently experienced (or even thought of) either simultaneously or in immediate succession, then whenever one of these impressions, or the idea of it, recurs, it tends to excite the idea of the other.” Magicians succeed by turning the mind against itself."

One is to display a shirt waist or a pair of shoes or any other articles so prominently that they attract the attention of the passer-by, who, seeing their desirably qualities, is induced to step in and purchase. If but one plate glass window existed in a town, that window, filled with any class of goods, would surely sell them. But there is competition everywhere—even in selling goods—and plate glass fronts line the streets of every village. No need to enter a store to know its contents; they most desirable items of the stocks are open to the gaze of all outsiders.” “Up-to-date Ideas,” <i>The Show Window</i> 2 no. 5 (April 1, 1898): 143."
