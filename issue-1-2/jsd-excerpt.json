        "summary": "An excerpt from Jackie Sibblies Drury's play, <i>We are Proud to Present…</i>, in which a group of black and white American actors struggle to make a play about Germany's genocide of the Herero in late-nineteenth century Southwest Africa. They have only one source, a cache of letters home from German soldiers, and their own misconceptions: sometimes funny, sometimes hideous. It does not go well."

Its plot is this: six black and white American actors attempt to make their own play about the imperial German genocide of the Herero people of South West Africa in the late nineteenth, early twentieth century. After a rapid-fire, surprisingly slapstick overview of the history, the play’s main body follows the well-meaning but often egotistical actors as they chafe at the primary source that they hoped might inspire their work: a cache of letters sent home by German soldiers.",

The play barrels headlong to a fierce and upsetting conclusion, but in this excerpt, at least, tempers are not so frayed that the play isn’t still bitingly funny. A challenging balance of social criticism, racial violence, and inquiry into how deeply we can empathize with the dead, <i>We Are Proud to Present</i> is the breakout contribution of a new voice in American theater. We are grateful to Sibblies Drury for the chance to introduce it to <i>The Appendix</i>’s readers.",
