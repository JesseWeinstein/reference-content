It’s been raining for a week now, and most of her garments are sodden on the line strung between the ledge of her bedsitter window and the brick tenement across the other side of cobblestone alley. She glances out the window, smeared with fat from cooking bacon and chips on the one gas ring in the bedsit, and looks at the clothes, thinks they look like exotic coloured birds wet through, out of their clime, huddled together for warmth against the weather.",

A bit stuffy she thinks, but better than being outside in that lot. She breaks a nail; the purple bits fall like pottery shards all over the unmade bed. Rose swears softly under her breath. Not like the last time something happened to upset her.",

A bit rough for someone like Mr. Bates, Rose thought later, but he didn’t want to see her walk away from him into the crowd, she knew. And so it went from there.",

I find the same bleakness in the painting [_Woman Filing Her Nails_](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/9142/). It is easy to see the setting as warm and even welcoming, but the single room is stifling for the woman and the viewer of the painting. There is a desolation despite the fact that it is a very sexy painting; the woman’s legs and breasts are almost completely exposed. There is the suggestion of prostitution; the woman may well be waiting for another client to arrive. In my story, I made the main character instead face the choice between her rich older lover and the man she loves, Johnny Shortcross.",
