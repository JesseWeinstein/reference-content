        "summary": "In 1965, a Chinese playwright named Meng Chao fell afoul of the cultural revolution because of a fictional ghost named Li Huiniang. In 1381, that ghost came to life, challenging a tyrant for the love of another poor writer. Maggie Greene follows Li Huiniang from Maoism on back to her Ming dynasty beginnings."

The shape of the film’s story was familiar, true: a ghost tale told in China for six hundred years or more. But to contemporary eyes, its surface now seems crowded and cheapened by the special effects that the Shanghai film studio piled onto it. Fog, flashbacks, and visual tricks made literal what earlier versions of <i>Li Huiniang</i>, a traditional Chinese opera, had often left to the imagination. However, there is no doubt that the story of a tragic Song dynasty (960-1279 CE) concubine, the titular Li Huiniang, who returns from the dead after being unjustly slain by a corrupt prime minister, still found favor with audiences. This was a haunting ghost.",

Actors made do with elaborate costumes, fire breathing, colorful face paint, and spectacular acrobatics. Traditional Chinese theatre is austere to the extreme: outside of the exquisite costumes and elaborate makeup, stages are bare, and a set of conventions replace props and sets. Often, the audience is expected to conjure the particulars of a scene in their heads. Actresses gesture to empty stages while singing of lush gardens and gilded pavilions. The horse a general rides is symbolized by a fringed horsehair whip. One set of table and chairs can set a thousand scenes. It is a world away from movie sets, multiple takes and fog machines.",

She looked, and Meng Chao was lying on his bed, blood trickling from his nose, dead. At that time, the ‘Gang of Four’ [Jiang Qing’s clique] was still in power,so several friends had to carry his remains on their shoulders to take him to be cremated—in the end, he never got to see the ‘Gang of Four’ fall from power; he just wore his [bad element] cap and ‘went to see Marx.’",

The essay criticizing it, carefully orchestrated by Jiang Qing and other radicals, may have led to the formal launch of the Cultural Revolution, but it was hardly the first spark.  That honor belonged to Meng Chao and his lovely ghost, Li Huiniang, the kindling that allowed those early fires to burn so brightly. In the first six months of 1965, it was in fact Meng Chao and his ghost who faced severe criticism in the pages of leading journals and papers. _Li Huiniang_ had faced the ire of cultural radicals since 1963, even inspiring a ban on portraying ghosts in theater—the harbinger of the PRC’s swiftly increasing radicalization of culture and politics.",

They were poisonous weeds, evidence of the sickness the Chinese Communist Party still harbored, a sickness that needed to be excised as quickly as possible, by any means necessary. Historical settings were dangerous, for it was never “history for history’s sake,” as men like Wu Han liked to claim. There was a long tradition in China of indirect remonstrance, the use of historical parables to criticize an emperor or high official. It was clear, or so claimed the essays attacking Meng Chao, Wu Han, and the dramatist Tian Han, that these authors, senior members of the intellectual establishment, were using their significant literary and academic chops to bring about their own _bourgeois_, _capitalist_ goals.

                "Ma Jianling was a luminary in the theatre world, known not for exquisite poetry and deft deployment of classical allusions, but for sticking close to Mao’s stated ideals for socialist art and literature. He and Meng Chao were both true believers in both traditional opera and its potential for socialist adaptation, but his Li Huiniang, of <i>Wandering West Lake</i>, could not have been more different from the Li Huiniang that sprung from Meng Chao. His ghost play was ghostless.<br /><br />On the surface, it was an eminently logical approach to a dramatic element that had become undesirable. From the late nineteenth century on, Chinese intellectuals had been overwhelmingly concerned with the “backward” nature of Chinese culture and people, represented by fortune telling, belief in fate, and all other <i>unmodern, unscientific</i>, superstitious thinking. And what could be more superstitious than belief in ghosts and gods—the idea that after death, people could return in ghostly form to right wrongs or instruct the living?<br /><br />In Ma’s version, there is a complicated twist of mistaken identity, a doppelgänger of Li Huiniang named Li <i>Rui</i>niang, and an ending that required no one to die (or more importantly, return from the dead as a ghost). Many artists and intellectuals were—unsurprisingly—horrified. Here was the end result of all those things that sounded so wonderful in the abstract, the calls for purely socialist literature aimed at the proletariat: a ghost play without a ghost! In making it suitable for the superstitious masses, Ma had ruined the play for <i>the intellectuals</i>, those with the education to appreciate the immense weight of a glorious literary past. It was probably the first time many of them had really seen the full implications of revising, adapting, and creating art that measured up to their pre-1949 calls. They realized that creating socialist art, in its most extreme form, would mean jettisoning the great achievements that they could call their own. What would then be left?<br /><br />The fury of intellectual circles must have shocked Ma, and he soon revised his revision. He made Li Huiniang a ghost once more, and it is this version of Ma’s play that remained on the books. Recent reprinting of his <i>Wandering West Lake</i> show no trace of his ghostless ghost play. <br /><br />See Liu Naichong, “Duzhe dui Ma Jianling gaibian ‘You xihu’ juben yijian” [Readers’ opinions on Ma Jianling’s revised script ‘Wandering West Lake’] <i>Juben</i> (June 1955): 162-166."
