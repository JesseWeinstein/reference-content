She is perhaps the only cartoonist ever to be published by both Marvel Comics and _The New Yorker_. Beaton’s often absurdist, seemingly effortless style is deceiving: her comics’ humor lies in sharply-crafted progressions and punchlines that reimagine the past with barbed wit. Whether she’s revisiting Robinson Crusoe from the perspective of a disgruntled Friday or [lampooning the Brontë sisters](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=202), Beaton shows her originality as an historical thinker at every turn.",

Sometimes you read something and make a note and never get back to it, or you try something for a few days, and know that you have to move on to a new topic because this idea is going nowhere. I would love to make a comic about [Ida B. Wells ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells)—she’s a hero! But she didn’t have it easy. It’s easier to take down the big blowhards of history with humor, less easy to celebrate the underdogs, unless the joke every time is that they kick everyone’s asses or something.",

Or you could, but you don’t want to. But then you can’t always make the joke that everyone else around them is foolish while they are perfect—that gets old fast. Not that our heroes are untouchable, it’s just harder to turn into comedy. But, not impossible.",

            "content": "<span class='interview-participant'>Beaton</span> Cape Breton Island is made up of a few distinct cultural populations, but in Mabou and area it’s predominantly people of Highland Scots ancestry, who left Scotland during or after the Clearances. It was an isolated area for a long time, so though I am ninth generation or so, my grandparents’ first language was Gaelic. And we learned it in school, and the signs are English/Gaelic bilingual, though that’s not really necessary now. You are very aware of your own history in Mabou—your family line, where they came from, your relation to anyone in town. And there is a great cultural pride about it—not being Scottish, but being Cape Breton Gaels, is its own thing. I am not descended from great musicians, that is in other families. I used to wish “the music was in us” as they say, but I am descended from local bards, so that fits well enough, since I am a storyteller too in a way.",

I guess that is news to me. More likely, historical topics have always been of interest to storytellers—films, novels, shows. Comics too. Books like Chester Brown’s [_Louis Riel_](http://www.amazon.com/Louis-Riel-A-Comic-Strip-Biography/dp/1894937899) or Nick Bertozzi’s [_Lewis and Clark_](http://www.amazon.com/Lewis-Clark-Nick-Bertozzi/dp/1596434503/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383066243&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nick+bertozzi+lewis+and+clark), you know, they’re top notch.",

I was the Admin Assistant, so I was put where I was needed, and got to work a little bit in all the departments. I saw how hard it is to run a museum, and how people put all they have into it, because something is always about to happen that is just going to shut the whole place down. You’re bailing out a sinking ship, but you want to, you’re dedicated to it. You believe in it. I think working in the museums assured me that I believe in the importance of knowing history, and sharing it. It for sure shaped my comics—I worked in three museums in different towns, all told, but I started the website when I was working in Victoria, surrounded by maritime history. I think one of the first comics I drew was about going on a date with Admiral Nelson, and finding out how he was missing a bunch of body parts. Very mature.",

I was reading a lot of medieval history last year, but some of it was a snooze. It’s not always easy to be engaging. And I recently read a fantastic biography of Roald Dahl, but I don’t know if that counts as a history. I think about Robert Hughes’s [_The Fatal Shore_](http://www.amazon.com/Fatal-Shore-Epic-Australias-Founding/dp/0394753666/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383075514&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fatal+shore) a lot, and John Keegan’s [_Soldiers_](http://www.amazon.com/Soldiers-History-Battle-John-Keegan/dp/0670809691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383075537&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=john+keegan+soldiers), I’m picking at Joseph J. Ellis’s [_Founding Brothers_](http://www.amazon.com/Founding-Brothers-The-Revolutionary-Generation/dp/0375705244), but I’ll be honest, it’s been around the house for ages.
