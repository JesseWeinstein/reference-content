In our fourth issue, we featured a romping, [cartographic biography](http://theappendix.net/issues/2013/10/the-appendix-appendixed) by the artist Kevin Cannon about a Danish explorer named Peter Freuchen. And when we remembered that Ottaviani, Cannon, and the other half of the art studio [Big Time Attic](http://www.bigtimeattic.com/), Zander Cannon—no relation—had collaborated on a graphic history of paleontological skullduggery and childish competition in the American West, we knew we needed to feature it in “Digs.”",

Fanning the flames of their competition were newspapers like the _New York Herald_ and participants—sometimes caught in the crossfire—like P. T. Barnum, Wild Bill Cody, the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud, Alexander Graham Bell, and Charles R. Knight, whose art brought dinosaurs to life for the public.",

In the lovely excerpt that follows, the sympathetic Knight gets a lesson in how to breathe warmth into supposedly cold-blooded creatures on paper, and Cope arrives in Wyoming, where the Geological Survey is assisting the collector to gather his dinosauric dead. Afterward Cope gives his own lesson imagining the past, and Marsh gets ready to pull the wool over his eyes.",
