The project proved so rich—Cannon had to leave out Freuchen digging himself out of an ice cave with a knife made of his own excrement—that we’ve decided to make it a regular feature, leaping from continent to continent, map to map, life to life.",

To my embarrassment it dawned on me that I really had no knowledge of Syria’s geography or history, and I figured that it was my duty as an American to at least know something about the country we were going to invade. Fortunately the war never happened, and I can say that I’m now slightly less ignorant about this small corner of the globe.",

            "content": "After reading through the only book on Syria in my local library, I stumbled on a very brief mention of someone named Bell who, according to the passage, traveled through snow during her time in Syria. The mention of snow in what I thought was a burning desert climate of course caught my attention. The Bell in question is Gertrude Bell, an extremely adventurous English woman who wore many hats in the early nineteenth century, from spy and political officer to archaeologist and cartographer. From what I could tell she took several solo trips into some of the most remote parts of Syria, which seemed a risky feat for a woman on her own at the turn of the last century. I knew then that somewhere in her travels was a map waiting to be illustrated.",

She’s actually most famous for her work in Iraq, but because my initial focus was on Syria I decided to flesh out her adventures based on her 1907 book, _The Desert and the Sown_ (originally titled “Syria”). The title is taken from an Omar Khayyám verse about the line that separates the explored and the unexplored, and Bell definitely made it her goal to travel past the sown into the dangerous and mostly unexplored desert.",

The greater goal of her 1905 journey was to visit ruins north of Damascus, although there’s no way she could have passed up seeing some of the great ruins south of Damascus that she missed during her first visit there. As noted on the map, most of the ancient buildings in the Hauran were built with a dark and very strong volcanic rock called basalt, which means that the region was—and still is—littered with many ruins from the last two millennia. Armed with the maps and travelogues of the few Western men who had explored this region before her, Bell used this trip to visit as many ruins as she could, even traveling far East into the dangerous Safa to do so.",

Bell describes all of this richly in her writings but I’m afraid that level of detail is missing from the map.",

She does describe the wives of the Sheiks in some places, but only in the context of them being guests in the tents. Maybe Bell wasn’t particularly concerned about women on this trip or maybe she didn’t feel it was her role to discuss it, but its absence from the greater conversation about Syria and her Druze hosts struck me as odd.",
