A pair of [articles](#4) [debate](#5) whether the humble digger of the Kalahari desert, the meerkat, can be said to have a history, while contributions from graphic novelist [Jim Ottaviani](#6) and fiction writer [Michele Stepto](#7) round out the chapter.",

[Julia Gaffield](#1) describes how she unearthed Haiti’s long-lost Declaration of Independence, which made international news in 2010. [Dan Buck](#2) sifts through the fragments of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and [Josi Ward](#3) traverses the dusty towns around California’s Salton Sea on the lookout for fast-fading traces of the migrant labor camps of the 1930s. [Corinne Lampert](#4) brings us a tale of digging in the Lucca archives, and the talented [Kevin Cannon](#5) returns with another cartographic biography, this time of a pioneering female archaeologist. Sometimes the passage of time itself can be a form of burial, as [Charles Shaw](#6) documents in a spectacular article and group of photos documenting the fading Soviet triumphalism of a Moscow park. Finally, three poems from [Molly Brodak](#7) elegize the death of a geologist and “the romance of bones.”",

But digs can also be insults—taking a dig at someone has a long history which is traced in our “[Historical Digs](#3)” piece, and in [Erika Bsumek](#4)’s profile of the painter George Catlin and the disastrous consequences of his portrait of a Lakota warrior named Mah-tó che-ga.",
