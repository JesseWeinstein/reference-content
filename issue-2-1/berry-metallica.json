            "content": "For contemporary artist Justin Berry, the most fascinating features of the book are these woodcuts and the multiple levels on which they operate. Like all drawings from observation, they reveal more than they intend. Though their overt purpose is to show the mechanisms and implements of the mining process, they also show the world around those objects, such as the ground ripped open, the trees cut down, and the refuse of the mining process running off into the waterways.",

We see a scene that appears to be the aftermath of a battle or the site of some natural catastrophe. Though in truth it is neither, perhaps in some ways it is both.",
