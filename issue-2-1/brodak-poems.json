She wrote back with three poems that brilliantly evoke the past as foreign country. Each of these poems is concerned with a kind of burial—the death of a geologist, the artifacts left by “the people before,” the “romance of bones” at a saint’s tomb. Yet they also hinge on transformations. “Spikes of stars and blank ribbons waving from mouths / across the Apocalypse Tapestry” find new life “as floor mats, horse blankets, frost wrap / for the orange trees,” and “girls’ gold-locked skull parts” are patched with replacements from “mastiffs / and old men.”",
