Galdy, a French merchant, was among 6,500 people living in Port Royal, Jamaica, in the last decade of the seventeenth century. By this time, this notorious privateering haven had developed into one of the most densely populated cities in the Western Hemisphere.  Its sizeable population lived and worked among approximately 2,000 structures, all of which were crowded into a mere 53 acres of land.",

For three minutes tremors pulsated across the cay, transforming its paradaisical landscape into a bed of quicksand.  The sandy soil of Port Royal resulted in a geological phenomenon known as liquefaction.  When fault lines shift under a sandy location, instead of shaking, the earth quite literally envelops whatever is on its surface.",

Tales of Port Royal’s rowdy inhabitants were well known throughout the Atlantic world.  John Taylor, who visited Jamaica in 1687, explained that Port Royal was “verey lose in itself, and, by reson of privateres and debauched wild blades wich come hither.”  The city, he continued, “‘tis now more rude and anticque [i.e. antic] than ‘ere was Sodom, fill’d with all maner of debauchery.” The 1692 earthquake was seen as God’s divine judgment on the people of Port Royal.  Pamphlets published in the wake of the earthquake reinforced this sentiment.  A local minister who had hoped “to keep up some shew of Religion among a most Ungodly Debauched People,” explained that the town “had much the greatest share in this terrible Judgment of God.”",

My dissertation on early modern Caribbean cities had led me to Kingston, where I was researching in the National Library of Jamaica and the Department of Archives.  Curious to see the wickedest city in the west (or at least its remnants) for myself, I took a cab to Port Royal one Saturday morning.  After ten or so minutes of driving through Kingston, my cab driver soon turned onto a coastal road that took me alongside the Kingston Harbor and then onto the Palisadoes Spit, a narrow strip of land that separates the harbor from the sea.  Gazing out the taxi window to my left, I could see the waves of the Caribbean Sea crashing down on a man-made rock wall.  To my right, the calmer waters of Kingston Harbor were dotted with fishermen and container ships.  Ten minutes and seven miles later, I found myself at the end of the road.  There lay the sleepy fishing town of Port Royal.",

I asked her about the church I had seen on my arrival. Curious about the unassuming white church I had been dropped off beside, I began badgering the tour guide. Was it worth visiting? Was it open?  When was it built?",
