On the surface, he writes, “I was probably most interested in the prospects of solitary exploration. But I’d like to think that I was also compelled by forces outside myself—that, on some level, I might have been dimly aware of the Internet’s role in the fulfillment of some ancient, human yearning to externalize our private imaginations into a shared space.”",

Martin’s _Game of Thrones_ had hit bookstore shelves in the late summer of 1996, and the book’s now-familiar style was in full effect among the drunken dwarves, goth giants, and coquetish bards of Elanthia. Beneath the wince-inducing fantasy trappings, though, was a stark realization: the game was _work_. To get anywhere in Gemstone—which meant becoming a “lord” or “lady,” the appellation bestowed on players who reached level twenty or above—one had to devote thousands of hours to wandering textual cliffs and bogs, swinging digital blades at algorithmic trolls and cyber snow leopards. With each attack, a burst of numbers and calculations danced across the screen, swiftly scrolling upward out of view: rolls of virtual dice to calculate which vein had been severed by a rapier thrust, or the precise amount of poison damage that accrues from a basilisk bite to the toes.",
