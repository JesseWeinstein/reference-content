Rather, it is a poignant bruising of the self that occurs while looking at photograph, that dreadful recognition that everyone photographed is dead or will be dead. That is the photograph’s _punctum_, the elusive, yet poetic, capacity to prick or to wound. In Barthes’s now canonical meditation on the photograph, [_Camera Lucida_](http://books.google.com/books/about/Camera_Lucida.html?id=yT0iaUzDmIUC), he is pricked by a condemned man, by Alexander Gardner’s winsome portrait of Lewis Payne.  “_He is going to die_,” Barthes writes of the Lincoln conspirator, “I read at the same time: _This will be_ and _this has been_.” As Barthes considers Payne’s portrait—taken for reasons similar to Vaillat’s—he shudders “_over a catastrophe which has already occurred_.”",

The guillotine will sever his head, the photograph will preserve his death somewhere in the “anterior future.” But perhaps the guillotine and the photograph share more than an abstract link to death. They are both symbols of technological modernity.

But perhaps the most idiosyncratic treatment of the guillotine belongs to Antoine Wiertz. Wiertz, an obscure Belgian painter, produced a curious triptych titled _Thoughts and Visions of a Severed Head_ (1853). The painting—and its [accompanying text](http://books.google.com/books?id=dI1U8cRGXpIC&amp;printsec=frontcover)—attempts to recount the thoughts and feelings of a post-mortem head in order to determine if “the head, after its separation from the trunk, remain for a few seconds capable of thought?”",

Monsieur D acquiesced. He made some preparations and then we waited not without excitement for the fall of a human head.” Wiertz’s magnetopathic experience paid off in the most macabre manner: “The head of the executed man, saw, thought, and suffered,” the painter wrote, “And I saw what he saw, understood what he thought, and felt what he suffered.”",

The executed man must have thought: three hundred years.” Each panel thus represents one minute of a severed head’s death post-decapitation: the release of blade and removal, to the head’s “raging delirium” at the recognition of its detachment, and the violent suffering “in his viscera” as the head finally dies.",
