As one graduate told the press, “the sons of a washerwoman and of a millionaire are on the same footing when they enter the academy.” The cadets who testified at the inquiry reiterated this point but, importantly, they offered it less as a statement of fact and more as a statement of purpose.

For them, hazing was simply a small painful step on the road to popularity. Cadet Fred Deen, for example, admitted that as a freshman he had been badly bruised in a fifty-eight round boxing match with an upperclassman, but that it wasn’t that bad because “he came out of the fight with glory.” Another cadet pointed out that popular cadets were subjected to more harassment than their unpopular peers, and that being ignored was much worse than being abused.",

Even immediately after the fight, two cadets continued to provoke Booz. Cadet Orfield Tyler told him that he had not “acted exactly fair” during the match, and Cadet John Herr chided him “that his actions were cowardly and were so regarded by the others.” To give a sense of how universally disliked Booz was, Tyler and Herr were the cadets Booz had selected to be his seconds in the boxing match, two schoolmates he evidently felt close to at the academy (a feeling that Cadet Tyler was sure to confirm was in no way mutual, assuring the court that he only served as Booz’s second because Booz had asked and he “could not well refuse”).",
