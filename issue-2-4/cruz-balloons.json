But the rude awakening was not at all reason for distress—rather, it was reason for joy and excitement. I would jump out of bed and run to the backyard, usually bumping into my older brothers, who were doing the same. The strange succession of bursts and explosions, we knew, could only mean one thing: balloons!",

The alarm clocks were easy to spot: balloons carrying enormous racks full of hundreds of fireworks of all sorts. They left huge trails of smoke in the sky, continuing their pyrotechnic displays sometimes for half an hour. But it was not all explosions. Some balloons bore long paper banners with intricate designs ranging from abstract patterns to the likeness of musicians and celebrities, someone’s girlfriend or mother, or, on many occasions, Jesus Christ. Those were silent, and if they were high up enough, you really had to look for them—and use the binoculars for a closer peek at their design.",

Looking to make even bigger, more complex, and awe-inspiring works of flying folk art, baloeiros beginning in the 1960s joined together in teams. By the 1980s, some balloons were as tall as 216 feet, and could carry hundreds of pounds of banners, light panels, or pyrotechnic displays. The art of ballooning had reached its golden age.",

The metal ring has a center shelf where the torch is loaded, keeping it away from the paper sides. Even though this structure is not visible once the balloon is launched, teams sometimes take great pains to embellish them, creating wire sculptures to hold the torch—a proper altar for the pyre which will take their beloved craft to the skies.",

For baloeiros taking to the sky with crafts of their own, Santos-Dumont was a hero who legitimized their own ascent to the skies. Baloeiros looking for legitimacy also range as far as the early eighteenth century. In 1709, Bartolomeu de Gusmão, a Brazilian priest, demonstrated a small balloon at the court of the Portuguese king—securing the exclusive patent to create a manned version of the craft (the king also passed an edict prohibiting the use of balloons to flee the country). Baloeiros often cite this as the first test of a balloon as airship.

Erik Von Däniken, in his pseudo-scientific book _Chariots of the Gods_ (a popular hit in Brazil), assigns the cause for such drawings to the presence of extraterrestrial beings. But the baloeiros could not let aliens take their glory. Humberto Pinto, writing for the baloeiro magazine [_Gazeta do Balão_](http://gazetadobalao.com.br/), claims instead that it was the work of Andean balloonists. The claim rests on a successful 1975 experiment to recreate and fly the Nazca balloon based on a vase painting in a Lima museum and the materials available at the time.

They hold and slowly release the line until the payload starts to lift off the ground.  Banners slowly begin to unfold. Racks of fireworks hover just above the ground with a lit fuse. The heightening tension of this crucial moment is reflected by an increasing cacophony of voices coordinating the launch. At last, all voices are yelling the same command: _libera!_ (release). The moment after they let go of the guide lines is full of joyous celebration, teammates alternating between watching the balloon and hugging each other. Applause, whistling, and yelling dominates the atmosphere. After months of arduous preparation, the baloeiros—and their families, friends, and community—get to admire the artistic details for a short time, until only the silhouette of the distant balloon is distinguishable.",

Those little balloons, launched by the dozens, were just a few sheets of paper glued together. One person would hold it, and another light the torch with matches, and off it went. But as ballooning evolved into its own folk art form, separating from the religious tradition, the balloons became ever bigger and more complex. By the early 1970s, they were reaching a golden age, with large balloons, creative designs, and innovative techniques. The secular balloons, once limited to teams in just a few communities, spread like wildfire—by the early 1980s there were hundreds of teams in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Two factors marked this incredible growth in the practice of launching balloons: the creation of new techniques for building larger balloons, and the sharing of this knowledge among an increasing community of baloeiros.",

The idea of using propane torches came from metal workers and other laborers who were also baloeiros (most balloon teams hail from working class neighborhoods). With propane torches inflating the balloons on the ground, they could be kept inflated while the team made preparations, and most importantly, this allowed much bigger balloons to be launched.",

Also, they are seen as a fun and adrenaline-filled activity for young men, who will chase them even if they are not baloeiros themselves. Historically resgates have been a very cordial and organized process, regimented by an unwritten code of conduct.  The first rule is that a flying balloon has no owner: anyone who reaches a landing balloon first can keep it to make a second launch. Second, if more than one crew reaches it at the same time, or if multiple groups collaborate on the retrieval, they make an impromptu lottery, with a member of each team entering the lottery to see who keeps the balloon.",

Unlike earlier newspaper reports that praised the art and curiously peered into the world of baloeiros, interviewing them and showing their craft, journalists moved balloons from the culture section of the paper to the crime and police pages. An extensive search through TV and paper reports on balloons reveals that almost every report was about a police raid apprehending what they now called “safe houses,” the garages or workshops of baloeiros.  The TV reports on balloons now took the exact format of police reporting. It is very customary for instance, in cases of drug raids, for the officers to pose with the contraband and weapons captured. The same now happens with balloons: police officers stand in front of the cameras, talking about their raid, with piles of paper, glue, ropes, fireworks, and a folded balloon behind them.  Some cities have even created a _Disque-Balão_ (Balloon Crime Hotline) for citizens to anonymously report on balloon launches or workshops.",

The civil aviation authorities started taking balloons very seriously, and the documentary included sound bites from radar air traffic controllers in Rio forced to treat balloons as air traffic, stating their positions to pilots in the same way they would report the position of any other aircraft to direct a pilot around it. One can only imagine what international airline pilots must think when the control tower instructs them to change course in order to avoid a huge balloon with a pyrotechnic show hanging underneath it.",

In 1998, they founded the _Sociedade Amigos do Balão_ (Society for Friends of the Balloon, or SAB) with that very goal in mind. Some SAB members have proposed a solution similar to one which regulated _Carnaval_ decades ago: the construction of the _sambódramo_, an official stadium-like arena where parades can be held. The SAB proposed a _balódramo_ outside the city, with stadium seating, where balloons could be launched at designated times in a regimented fashion regulated by the state government. The balódramo is the solution that comes the closest to resolving air traffic issues, since the airspace around it could be reserved much like it is for other aerial sports, such as the manned hot-air ballooning practiced elsewhere in the world.",

The Rio de Janeiro government, for instance, made an exception for allowing a balloon festival, provided that the balloons could be made visible by air traffic radar. The online magazine _Planeta Balão_ quickly prepared a white paper for baloeiros so they could adapt to this requirement. They used information from the Brazilian Air Force’s Aeronautics Technological Institute to figure out a design for a radar reflector to be built for just $5 from aluminum foil. They also introduced new metal rims for the torches—these would now be covered by electrical tape so as to not short circuit power lines when landing in the city.",

They added a payload that consisted of a full water cooler, with a small opening at the bottom. The timed draining of the water slowly made the balloon lighter, compensating for the loss of lift due to the cooler air, and maintaining the craft at a stable altitude.  The eco-friendly fireless balloons have had some success. There are now state-sanctioned annual festivals for fireless balloons. But the practitioners of “green” ballooning are a minority of the estimated 40,000 baloeiros in the cities of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Curitiba. Many believe that fire is the essence of the art, often saying that “fire is the soul of the balloon.”",

A Rio de Janeiro baloeiro solved this with a structural invention, a method by which balloons could be built in modules, allowing the giants to be manufactured in small garages in the peripheries."
