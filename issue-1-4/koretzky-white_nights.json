Years later, after a long stint in Siberia, he returned to Petersburg and wrote the memoirs of the Underground Man, a very different kind of dreamer. The dark, ugly, stinking Petersburg of _Notes from Underground_ is nothing like the Petersburg of _White Nights_, but they are nevertheless the same city. Petersburg is a state of mind, a geographical space that can be the best or the worst place on the earth depending on the season and your mood. In the words of the Underground Man, it is at once “the most abstract and intentional city in the world.”",

But Petersburg now is not in remont so much as it is in abandonment, like the workers left one day for their lunch break and never came back. Abandoned factories with smashed-out windows line the streets of Vasilevsky Island. The apartment buildings in this section of the city, where the tourists never go, are all Brezhnev-era concrete monstrosities. At night, more than half the windows are dark. During the day, you can see the gaping holes of broken windows and graffiti in ugly colors. Weeds and gangly trees grow amongst rebar and crumbled concrete in the abandoned lots between buildings.",

A narrow, superbly straight canal bisects the island cleanly, running out to the Gulf of Finland. The giants who were supposed to live here never came. The new kind of man for whom these buildings were constructed never materialized. But the entire city still feels like it is waiting, which is another kind of stasis. And while they wait in the perpetual twilight, Petersburg’s entirely human inhabitants laugh and talk and smoke, play music on the banks of the canal, hang their laundry out of the windows. They are squatters, homeless people in this city of giants, but they live and keep on living and are not alone.",

You have to give up control over the things you can’t change, you have to learn to live in the electric space of chance. In Russian, the word for lucky, _schastlivi,_ is the same as the word for happy. I am truly alive in the eleven seconds of travel in the elevator.

We go to _Novaya Gollandiya_, an island in the middle of the city where we have picnic dinners and listen to music. We visit the Peter-Paul Fortress, once the most feared prison in Tsarist Russia, now a public park where young Russians stroll hand in hand.

We switch to Russian and immediately the girl in the bunk next to me introduces herself. _Babushki_ offer us strawberries, which we accept.

We put our offerings on the table and split them. Later on, the train rumbles past Lake Ladoga, where fishermen fish in the 4 am twilight and where, in the terrible winters of 1941-44, supply trucks cut their way across the ice in an effort to stem rampant starvation in blockaded Petersburg. “We has more soul than other people,” Sergei tells me. “We have,” I correct his grammar absently, but I think I know what he means anyway.",

While I was hurtling through the dark tunnels below the Neva, somewhere above dawn broke in earnest on Petersburg.  The entire city is tinged in gold, it glitters on the canal, fills the stairwell of my building from the ground floor up, breaking past the bars on the first floor window.

I try to imagine myself walking home in 1949, ‘59, ‘69. In the archives, the old newspapers crackle as I go back even farther. I read about a wedding that happened across the road one hundred and forty years ago, about a scandal that erupted on Nevsky Prospekt just down the street and two hundred years in the past.

The very edge of Vasilevsky Island was once _Smolenskoe Pole_, the execution grounds for state criminals. The Decembrists, an aristocratic group of revolutionaries, were killed and buried here in the 1820s. The five infamous members of the People’s Will, the group of terrorists who killed Alexander II, lie here too, somewhere beneath the concrete foundations of the 1950s high rises, or perhaps along the weedy banks of the canal. Walking home very early in the morning, when it is well and truly dark for the first time in weeks, I can almost feel their breath on the back of my neck.

All of the other women are far older than we are—grandmothers, with sagging flesh and wrinkled bodies.

                "The construction of Saint Petersburg has a fascinating history. As Dostoevsky’s Underground Man notes, Petersburg was built virtually overnight because of the will of one man, Peter the Great. The building of Petersburg was notoriously difficult—a vast number of serfs died digging the canals and laying the foundations that transformed swampy islands into habitable land. The city continued to expand after it was founded in the early 1700s. The construction of a canal bisecting the western half of Vasilevsky Island in the mid-twentieth century made it possible to start development in this sector of the city.",
                "_Remont_ is a Russian word meaning “renovation,” but with a much wider usage than the English equivalent. For example, signs cautioning pedestrians about road work or building repairs use this word. Walter Benjamin comments on the usage of this word in _Moscow Diary_ (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1986)."
