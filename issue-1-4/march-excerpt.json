        "summary": "John Lewis would become one of the youngest heroes of America’s Civil Rights movement, leading marches in the face of racist and authoritarian abuse. In this excerpt of his graphic memoir, however, he was an eighteen-year-old seminary student—about to meet Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for the very first time."

We interview Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell—the writer and artist who are helping Lewis put his inspiring life into comic book form—elsewhere in this issue, but there’s no substitute for the beauty they bring to his story. From his Alabama childhood to his first flush of victory during the Nashville student lunch counter sit-ins, this initial volume of a projected three-part graphic novel brings Lewis’s life to the page. And in the wake of this summer’s Supreme Court decision striking down a crucial condition of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, it is a story whose message comes at exactly the right time.",

The following excerpt begins after Lewis decides to leave the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville and attempts to transfer to Troy State, back in Alabama, where no black students were allowed. His application is met with silence. He decides to introduce himself to the only person he thinks can help: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",
