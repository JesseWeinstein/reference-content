        "summary": "Sometime in the late sixteenth century, an indigenous painter in Mexico put brush to paper and brought his world, a region named Cempoala, to life. The map, part of a <i>relación geográfica</i> made for the king of Spain, became one of the most important sources for regional history in the sixteenth-century New World. Barbara Mundy explains why."

It passed from the central hub of the imperial bureaucracy in Mexico City out to crown officials in the provinces. There, they considered its fifty questions with care, and in indigenous majority cities and towns (there were many) they called native leaders into their office, often called the _casa real_. An interpreter translated the questions into [Nahuatl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl), or [Zapotec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_languages), or [Mixtec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec), or whatever the common language was. If Europeans believed that the world’s once-unified language had broken at Babel and scattered across the face of the earth, then Mexico’s hundreds of indigenous languages sat at the extreme frontier of that linguistic diaspora.",

Question ten asked for a _pintura,_ a term that might be translated to _tlacuilolli_ in Nahuatl, understood to be a map of the town or region. But the _tlacuilo_ (the person who created the tlacuilolli) was more than a scrivener. Rather, he (and sometimes she) was understood to have the capacity to translate immaterial knowledge into visible form. Every act of putting a brush loaded with pigment onto paper was an inquiry into the nature of the world.",

But rather than having their map conform to the standardized European sheet size, Cempoala’s artist(s) made the Spanish paper resemble its indigenous counterpart, piecing sheets together. The lines set on the image below mark the four large sheets, with two narrow additions across the top.",

This icon is itself a translation, almost certainly originating in one of the European prints that the native painter knew. Below is one such woodcut, set into a Bible printed in 1561 and imported to Mexico. In the scene from Genesis, the Tower of Babel is erected, and in the illustration, the basic conventions for rendering in perspective and shading are set out.",

The writer used both a different instrument—note the thin, sharp lines made by the edge of the pen’s nib on the ‘e’ and the ‘p’—and a different ink, iron gall, revealed by the rusty brown.",

The figure at the top is an indigenous noble, wearing discs of turquoise in his pierced ears and lip, his hair bound by a red leather strap.

When experiencing the physical landscape, the viewer stands at center, but in viewing the Relación Geográfica of Cempoala, _the map itself_ becomes the central pivot in the encounter. And in the fragments of the map reproduced here on a computer screen—cut out and isolated from the larger whole, scaled up and scaled down—an encounter with the centuries-old object is translated afresh into a digital language.",
