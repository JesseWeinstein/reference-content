He fooled his former owners, made it to Boston, and harbored hopes of finding his wife and daughter—and buying property near the land of his enslavement. In fleeing violence, can you reclaim it?"

It resonates most powerfully in their memoirs but also glows in their interviews and recollections from later years.  Whether slavery adhered to place or to the person was, of course, the question that framed the entire division of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America into ‘free states’ and ‘slave states.’  And worst of all, of course, were the ambiguous status of Kansas, Oklahoma, and the territories yet to be delineated in that cruel rubric of the antebellum period. How much did ‘place’ in the United States define citizenship, freedom and identity? Could one ever escape?",

If locale fundamentally defined identity, then one could assert the rights of citizenship or national identity by claiming one’s physical relationship to the larger land of America. Those rights were fragile, however, as Jackson soon discovered. The 1850 Fugitive Slave Act rendered slaves liable to forcible return to plantations no matter where they were, which effectively made geography within the United States irrelevant to one’s status. Under such a law, could a place ever be reclaimed or reoccupied under different terms by someone who fled bondage?",

Despite a brutal life of labor and abuse, he found some brief happiness with Louisa, a young woman he married who lived on a nearby plantation owned by the Law family. His owners objected to his marriage and to his spending time with his wife and Jenny, the daughter Jackson and Louisa conceived.

Whether calculated or impulsive, those kinds of flight were still powerful acts of defiance that indicated to overseers or masters that some treatment would not be endured. Despite threats of violence and cruelty, men and women still held some negotiating power: labor was a temporal force, and it meant more at planting or harvest time. If a person could hide for even a week or two, they could deprive their master of labor at an exceptionally critical moment. Punishing that slave too harshly upon their return could be only a pyrrhic victory.",

I went eight miles further, to Mr. Shipman’s hotel, where one Jessie Brown, who hired me of my master, had often stopped. I stayed there until midnight , when I got my pony and prepared to start.

He labored in Massachusetts for a few years, desperately saving money and networking with abolitionists in order to negotiate the purchase of his wife and baby girl, still enslaved in Georgia. Yet after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, Jackson quickly realized the danger he was in. His master had been making inquiries about him up North, and had commissioned a sort of bounty hunter or agent to track him down.  He had to give up on purchasing or ever reuniting with his family. This time, with the assistance of conductors on the Underground Railroad, Jackson made his way north to Canada, where he settled amongst the free black population of St John, New Brunswick.",

The Black River and the Santee river of South Carolina were notorious for harboring runaway communities who both literally and figuratively often reclaimed and redefined swamp land for small settlements and agricultural use. Jackson likely passed close to such territory, however, which makes his independent determination to flee all the more powerful. For a thoughtful consideration of the culture of Maroons in South Carolina, see _Maroon Communities in South Carolina: A Documentary Record_, Timothy James Lockley, editor (Charleston: University of South Carolina Press, 2009)."

                "The Reverend Thomas R. English’s runaway slave advertisement for Jackson appeared in the _Sumter Banner_ in March of 1847.  While it is rare to be able to correlate this kind of documentation for a specific fugitive and it tells us much about the Reverend’s perspective and, moreover, does indeed correlate with Jackson’s own version of events, this interpretation shouldn’t be allowed to define him.  After all, while The Reverend English may have found Jackson to speak “plausibly” it seems doubtful he was ever able to genuinely hear Jackson.  The misdirection (a probable route to Georgia) indicated within this advertisement also provides powerful evidence for the strategic maneuvers and resistance practiced by people desperate to elude enslavers and oppression."

                "As part of the Compromise of 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was a federal law designed to placate the South that was increasingly concerned by the weak enforcement of earlier fugitive slave laws. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 forced and rewarded Northern law enforcement officers to aid in the capture of escaped slaves. People aiding these freedom seekers were liable to face often very serious criminal sanctions. Other controversial aspects of the Act were the elimination of a jury decision for a captured slave, who was brought before a federal court or a commissioner and rarely allowed to submit testimony upon their behalf. Instead, testimony from the alleged owner, who was not even required to be present, was the most heavily-weighed evidence."
