                "The printed edition of the memoir was bundled with Psalmanazar’s last will and testament, itself a remarkable document. The will contains instructions for how to find Psalmanazar’s manuscript, directing his executors to “the deep drawer on the right hand of my white cabinet.” Psalmanazar described the text as a “manuscript I thought myself in duty bound to leave behind [as] a faithful narrative.”"

                "Psalmanazar defended laudanum as “being a great help to study, a reviver of the spirits, and the like,” but confessed that “I frequently took such large doses, by way of ostentation, as must have proved detrimental, if not quite fatal, to any man that had a less strong and happy constitution than I was blessed with… And this it was that emboldened me to take such large and dangerous draughts of it, without the least necessity or motive for it, but to be taken notice and talked of; insomuch that I continued it during such a number of years, that I was become a perfect slave to, and could not be easy without it, tho’ I had for some time been sensible of the ill consequences attending the constant use of it, especially as I often indulged my vanity with a larger dose than usual.”"

He replied; they had some from Africa, but they had more white slaves, and that he had once ate part of a black.”"
