Fragmentary data suggested a covert narrative: that CIA operatives, working with the expatriate American novelist, hired members of the French experimental writing coterie to translate Melville’s novel in the early 1970s as part of a larger project of cultural influence. If the history suggested here proves true, it will demand critical re-assessment of Mathews’s work, that of the Oulipo, and possibly even that of the so-called New York School poets, with whom Mathews has always been closely connected.",

The first, dated 26 April 1971, discusses how much the writer looks forward to working with Mathews on “Bartleby, their little project.” This seemed odd. The second, dated 1973, is even odder. It begins: “I don’t think what you sent me is going to work. I know you said Lepantou is writing in a kind of dialect, but it’s simply too queer. The translations are exceedingly liberal and there’s a fishy inconsistency of tone and style from chapter to chapter.” The letter-writer chastises Mathews for “getting in over his head” and “trying to pull a fast one,” then apologizes for having gotten him “involved at all.” He finishes by saying that he can’t return the manuscript.",

The novel is a faux-memoir, set in Paris in the early 1970s. Its conceit is as follows. Because he was an independent, unemployed American living in Paris, people assumed Mathews worked for the CIA. Frustrated by this constant misrecognition, he decided to turn the tables by pretending he _was_ in the CIA. Antics ensue, involving a lot of meetings and cocktail parties, and conclude with Mathews’s near-assassination in the French Alps. The novel ends with our protagonist in Berlin several years later, overhearing two anonymous agents reminiscing over his demise.",

The second letter mentions a “Patrick,” thus: “I ran into Patrick the other day and asked him about all this quackery. He wouldn’t give me a straight answer, slim. What’s really going on?” One Patrick Burton-Cheyne is a central—yet seemingly fictional—character in _My Life in CIA_.",

Mathews talks about lining up translators, meeting with friends, and so on. “I showed Alain the first couple of chapters Lepantou worked up from _Le Grand Escroc_,” he writes, “and he’s very excited.” _Le Grand Escroc_ is the title of Henri Thomas’s 1950 French translation of _The Confidence-Man_.

While doing unrelated research on the literary journal _Encounter_, its founding and funding by the CIA, and its exposure by _Ramparts_ in 1967, I happened—on a lark—to run “Bartleby” through the CIA’s FOIA declassified documents search engine. I had been thinking of the letter to Mathews and of _My Life in CIA_, and thought, “Wouldn’t it be funny if something came up.” Imagine my surprise when something did: a file titled _Operation Bartleby_, which discusses a wide-ranging project to influence French intellectuals and students, effectively renewing the work done by the Congress for Cultural Freedom in the fifties and sixties.",

He’s also a forger, a mimic, and an illusionist. “The art of contradiction making … that presents a shadow play of words” is the “blood and lineage which can, with perfect truth, be assigned the authentic Sophist.” Melville’s confidence men also appear and reappear under a variety of guises, contradicting other passengers and each other on topics ranging from the virtues of herbs to Indian-hating to the Bible, and always coming back to the question of faith: will you show confidence?

It is with fiction as with religion: it should present another world, and yet one to which we feel the tie.” Melville presents a critique of naïve “realism” consonant with the Oulipo’s wider critique of language.

But the preview is maybe that those who have, given them, a pea of this challenge, in addition to that they are not insensible to the kilometer post, are sometimes of this entirely possible scent making them cold, if not ingrates, when one comes to help them. For, with these pruning shears, to give warm, weighty slices, and well-meant exploits, is to play scientist; and there is nothing that well-placed geometry detests more, than one who appears to indicate that currency doesn’t have serious taste; but no, because currency, taking itself seriously, loves a serious scientist, and a serious Hungarian, of course, but only in their place: in theory.",

Ashbery and Mathews were close friends, both expatriates involved in the Parisian literary scene, and both connected with Harvard and the New York art world. Do these Melvillian threads suggest other, more clandestine connections?"

It will then be clear that language is a complex system, in which various elements are at work, whose combinations produce words, sentences, paragraphs, or chapters. Obviously, nothing prevents us from studying the behavior, in every possible circumstance, of each of these elements. On the contrary, it is only in this manner that experimental research into the possibilities of language can proceed” (Bénabou, Marcel, “Rule and Constraint” in _Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature_, edited by Warren F.

The larger the dictionary and the smaller the number, the closer in meaning are the two words, generally. Conversely, the smaller the dictionary and the larger the number, the more different they tend to be. Raymond Queneau has suggested provocatively that any text could _already be_ an N+7, for which we need only find the proper dictionary to uncover the original."
