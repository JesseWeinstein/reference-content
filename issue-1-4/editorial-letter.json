The future, which we don’t know, and cannot see, lurks behind.",

Initially, we meant it to be a ‘blank’ issue, one in which we didn’t tie the content together with a theme like ‘[Illusions](/issues/2013/4)’ or ‘[Out Loud](/issues/2013/7).’ But when the articles started coming in, a more natural theme developed: one concerned with a different sort of geography, a geography of absence and hidden traces. We gathered pieces deeply concerned with how to _look_ at history, and how to understand the motivations of the people who record it. And then there were the pieces that a grab-bag issue like this one truly does deserve, so distinctive that no other theme could fit them. Coming up on our one-year anniversary, it’s safe to say that ‘Off the Map’ is the most _Appendix_-y issue of _The Appendix_ yet.",

                "Much was made of this difference a few years ago in an article by Rafael E. Núñez and Eve Sweetser: “With the Future Behind Them: Convergent Evidence From Aymara Language and Gesture in the Crosslinguistic Comparison of Spatial Construals of Time,” _Cognitive Science_ 30 (2006), 29. To wit:<br /><br />«In Example 3 (male speaker, 73, from Pachama; bilingual interview), the speaker is talking about his “ancestors” (_achachilas_) when the interviewer suggests that this might have been the time of the Incas (_gentil timpu_). The speaker, who is thinking of more immediate ancestors such as great-grandparents, responds … “That is even further away before,” meaning that the Incas existed far earlier than what he is talking about. He gestures with both hands, an alternating rotating gesture upward and away from the body.»<br /><br />As to why, the authors suggested that it may partly come from the emphasis the Aymara language puts on visual perception as a source of knowledge. It turns out that Aymara is a historian’s dream language, distinguishing between firsthand knowledge and secondhand knowledge. If we are describing an event that we had witnessed, the grammatical construction –_Vna_ is added to the sentence; if we’ve only heard about it, _-tayna_ is added."
